* [loffice - Lazy Office Analyzer](https://github.com/tehsyntx/loffice)
	* Loffice is making use of WinAppDbg to extract URLs' from Office documents but also VB-script and Javascript. By setting strategical breakpoints it's possible to neutralize obfuscation and get the URL and file destination. Anti-analysis via WMI, for example detecting running processes or installed software is handled by patching the query string before the query is run.

		* [Truman](http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/tools/truman/)
			* Truman can be used to build a "sandnet", a tool for analyzing malware in an environment that is isolated, yet provides a virtual Internet for the malware to interact with. It runs on native hardware, therefore it is not stymied by malware which can detect VMWare and other VMs. The major stumbling block to not using VMs is the difficulty involved with repeatedly imaging machines for re-use. Truman automates this process, leaving the researcher with only minimal work to do in order to get an initial analysis of a piece of malware. Truman consists of a Linux boot image (originally based on Chas Tomlin's Windows Image Using Linux) and a collection of scripts. Also provided is pmodump, a Perl-based tool to reconstruct the virtual memory space of a process from a PhysicalMemory dump. With this tool it is possible to circumvent most packers to perform strings analysis on the dumped malware.

			* A world without malware is ideal but unlikely. Many of us would prefer *not* to install another layer of protection on their already resource constrained handheld mobile device. Alternatively, Android malware detection sans anti-virus installation has become a reality. Learn about how it’s possible to detect mobile malware using simple text messages with ZitMo NoM. ZeuS in the mobile, known as ZitMo, is infamous for intercepting SMS transmissions then redirecting them to a Command & Control in order steal banking and personal information. Research with SMS transmissions directed at mobile malware has resulted in the ability to detect ZitMo’s presence without anti,virus applications installed. Turning their own tools against them makes this even more of a rewarding endeavor. We are looking for malware researchers to contribute to the continued development of this open tool. The presentation will include the research, the infrastructure and a demonstration of ZitMo NoM. Live malware will be used during this presentation, assuming we get it to behave.

		* For this talk, a criminologist and a security researcher teamed up to hunt a large-scale botnet dubbed Linux/Moose that conducts social media fraud. Linux/Moose has stealth features and runs only on embedded systems such as consumer routers or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Using honeypots set up across the world, we managed to get virtual routers infected to learn how this botnet spread and operated. We performed a large-scale HTTPS man-in-the-middle attack on several honeypots over the course of several months decrypting the bots’ proxy traffic. This gave us an impressive amount of information on the botnet’s activities on social networks: the name of the fake accounts it uses, its modus operandi to conduct social media fraud and the identification of its consumers, companies and individuals. This presentation will be of interest to a wide audience. First, it will present the elaborate methodology we used to infect custom honeypots with Linux/Moose and led to contributions to the open-source Cowrie Honeypot Project. Second, it will describe the technical details behind the man-in-the-middle attack conducted to decrypt the traffic. The talk will further increase its draw by placing the botnet’s activities within a larger-scope: the illicit market for social media fraud. With the data gathered from the decrypted traffic and open-source research, market dynamics behind the sale of social media fraud will be presented, allowing an overview of the botnet’s potential profitability. Overall, this research elevates the standards of botnet studies as it not only investigates how a botnet is built, but also what drives it.

			* I will discuss how the market for exploit kits has been changing, in techniques, marketing and prices. I argue that the competitiveness between exploit kits shows a maturing market, but will leverage economic theory to demonstrate the limits to which that market will continue to mature. This should allow us to understand how exploit kits affect (and are affected by) the rest of the greater market for hacker services, from malware (as an input) to nation-state level attacks (e.g. trickle down from Hacking Team). I hope to provide a better understanding of how exploit kits work and how their sold as well as how this market can teach us about the rational choice to engage in criminal activity and how we might dissuade them.

Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years. In this talk, we'll focus on the 'B' variant of FruitFly that even now, is only detected by a handful of security products. We'll begin by analyzing the malware's dropper, an obfuscated perl script. As this language is rather archaic and uncommon in malware droppers, we'll discuss some debugging techniques and fully deconstruct the script.

			* This paper presents a proof of concept executable packer that does not use any custom code to unpack binaries at execution time. This is different from typical packers which generally rely on packed executables containing code that is used to perform the inverse of the packing operation at runtime. Instead of depending on custom code, the technique described in this paper uses documented behavior of the dynamic loader as a mechanism for performing the unpacking operation. This difference can make binaries packed using this technique more difficult to signature and analyze, but only when presented to an untrained eye. The description of this technique is meant to be an example of a fun thought exercise and not as some sort of revolutionary packer. In fact, it's been used in the virus world many years prior to this paper.
		* [Implementing a Custom X86 Encoder](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=25&t=sumry)
			* This paper describes the process of implementing a custom encoder for the x86 architecture. To help set the stage, the McAfee Subscription Manager ActiveX control vulnerability, which was discovered by eEye, will be used as an example of a vulnerability that requires the implementation of a custom encoder. In particular, this vulnerability does not permit the use of uppercase characters. To help make things more interesting, the encoder described in this paper will also avoid all characters above 0x7f. This will make the encoder both UTF-8 safe and tolower safe.
		* [Using dual-mappings to evade automated unpackers ](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=44&t=sumry)
			* Automated unpackers such as Renovo, Saffron, and Pandora's Bochs attempt to dynamically unpack executables by detecting the execution of code from regions of virtual memory that have been written to. While this is an elegant method of detecting dynamic code execution, it is possible to evade these unpackers by dual-mapping physical pages to two distinct virtual address regions where one region is used as an editable mapping and the second region is used as an executable mapping. In this way, the editable mapping is written to during the unpacking process and the executable mapping is used to execute the unpacked code dynamically. This effectively evades automated unpackers which rely on detecting the execution of code from virtual addresses that have been written to.

			* We evaluate a new type of malicious software that gains qualitatively more control over a system. This new type of malware, which we call a virtual-machine based rootkit (VMBR), installs a virtual-machine monitor underneath an existing operating system and hoists the original operating system into a virtual machine. Virtual-machine based rootkits are hard to detect and remove because their state cannot be accessed by soft- ware running in the target system. Further, VMBRs support general-purpose malicious services by allowing such services to run in a separate operating system that is protected from the target system. We evaluate this new threat by implementing two proof-of-concept VMBRs. We use our proof-of-concept VMBRs to subvert Windows XP and Linux target systems, and we implement four example malicious services using the VMBR platform. Last, we use what we learn from our proof-of-concept VMBRs to explore ways to defend against this new threat. We discuss possible ways to detect and prevent VMBRs, and we implement a defense strategy suitable for protecting systems against this threat.
		* [Truman](http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/tools/truman/)
			* Truman can be used to build a "sandnet", a tool for analyzing malware in an environment that is isolated, yet provides a virtual Internet for the malware to interact with. It runs on native hardware, therefore it is not stymied by malware which can detect VMWare and other VMs. The major stumbling block to not using VMs is the difficulty involved with repeatedly imaging machines for re-use. Truman automates this process, leaving the researcher with only minimal work to do in order to get an initial analysis of a piece of malware. Truman consists of a Linux boot image (originally based on Chas Tomlin's Windows Image Using Linux) and a collection of scripts. Also provided is pmodump, a Perl-based tool to reconstruct the virtual memory space of a process from a PhysicalMemory dump. With this tool it is possible to circumvent most packers to perform strings analysis on the dumped malware.

		* Abstract: We introduce PyTrigger, a dynamic malware analy- sis system that automatically exercises a malware binary extract- ing its behavioral profile even when specific user activity or input is required. To accomplish this, we developed a novel user activity record and playback framework and a new  behavior  extraction approach.  Unlike  existing research, the activity recording and playback  includes the context of every object  in  addition  to traditional keyboard and mouse actions. The addition of the con- text makes the playback more accurate and avoids dependenciesand pitfalls that come with pure mouse and keyboard  replay. Moreover,  playback  can  become  more  efficient by condensing common activities into a single action. After playback, PyTrigger analyzes the system trace using a combination of multiple states and  behavior  differencing  to accurately extract  the  malware behavior and user triggered behavior from the complete system trace  log.  We  present the  algorithms, architecture and evaluate the   PyTrigger prototype using 3994 real malware samples. Results and analysis are presented showing PyTrigger extracts additional behavior in 21% of the samples

This means that an analyst can inspect userspace processes, kernel drivers, and preboot environments in a single tool.  It was specifially designed for interactive dynamic malware analysis. rVMI isolates itself from the malware by placing its interactive debugging environment out of the virtual machine (VM) onto the hypervisor-level. Through the use of VMI the analyst still has full control of the VM, which allows her to pause the VM at any point in time and to use typical debugging features such as breakpoints and watchpoints. In addtion, rVMI provides access to the entire Rekall feature set, which enables an analyst to inspect the kernel and its data structures with ease.

		* [Analysis of Attacks Using a Honeypot - Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011]()
			* Abstract. A Honeypot is a software based security device, deployed to attract hackers by displaying services and open ports which are potentially vulnerable. While the attackers are diverted, t heir activities can then be monitored and an a- lysed to identify current a ttack methods and trends. A low - interaction Honeypot called Dion aea was chosen for this project because it can simulate services while preventing an attacker from gaining full control. Results were collected over the six week period of the experiment. The logged information of the o b- served attacks was analysed and compared with current vulnerabilities, the loc a- tions where the attacks were originating from and the time of day at the orig i- nating site. A profile of individual attackers can then be built to ga in an insight into the current attack trends in order to improve network defences.

			* InfoSec analysts are all somewhat familiar with honeypots. When they are given the proper attention, care and feeding, they produce invaluable information. This intelligence has been primarily used by security researchers and organizations with advanced defensive capabilities to study their adversaries and learn from their actions. But what about the rest of us? Honeypots are a lot of work to configure, maintain, and monitor -- how can an organization that is not focused on research gain valuable intelligence using honeypots and actively defend their network using the data obtained? The answer is honeypots for active defense. There are currently many open source security tool distributions that come pre-loaded with honeypots among other useful tools, however the honeypot software is often not deployed in an effective manner. This session will discuss techniques to deploy honeypots in ways that will not overburden the security team with massive logs to sift through and focuses on correlating active threat data observed in the honeypot with the production environment. When deploying honeypots effectively, this can give security analysts one additional mechanism to tip them off to nefarious activity within their network.
		* [Global Honeypot Trends - Elliot Brink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjd-r4WA0PU)
			* Many of my computer systems are constantly compromised, attacked, hacked, 24/7. How do I know this? I've been allowing it. This presentation will cover over one year of research running several vulnerable systems (or honeypots) in multiple countries including the USA, mainland China, Russia and others. We'll be taking a look at: a brief introduction to honeypots, common attacker trends (both sophisticated and script kiddie), brief malware analysis and the statistical analysis of attackers based on GeoIP. Are there differences in attacks based on where a computer system is located? Let's investigate this together! Beginners to the topic of honeypots fear not, the basics will be covered.

It is designed to provide reconaissance against attackers that use search engines as a hacking tool against your resources. GHH implements honeypot theory to provide additional security to your web presence.  Google has developed a powerful tool. The search engine that Google has implemented allows for searching on an immense amount of information. The Google index has swelled past 8 billion pages [February 2005] and continues to grow daily. Mirroring the growth of the Google index, the spread of web-based applications such as message boards and remote administrative tools has resulted in an increase in the number of misconfigured and vulnerable web apps available on the Internet.  These insecure tools, when combined with the power of a search engine and index which Google provides, results in a convenient attack vector for malicious users. GHH is a tool to combat this threat.

	* In this paper we present an efficient mechanism as well as the corresponding reference implementation for on-the-fly infecting of executable code with malicious software. Our algorithm deploys virus infection routines and network redirection attacks, without requiring to modify the application itself. This allows to even infect executables with a embedded signature when the signature is not automatically verified before execution. We briefly discuss also countermeasures such as secure channels, code authentication as well as trusted virtualization that enables the isolation of untrusted downloads from other application running in trusted domains or compartments.

* [Malware Guard Extension: Using SGX to Conceal Cache Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08719)
	* In this paper, we demonstrate fine-grained software-based side-channel attacks from a malicious SGX enclave targeting co-located enclaves. Our attack is the first malware running on real SGX hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal itself. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack both in a native environment and across multiple Docker containers. We perform a Prime+Probe cache side-channel attack on a co-located SGX enclave running an up-to-date RSA implementation that uses a constant-time multiplication primitive. The attack works although in SGX enclaves there are no timers, no large pages, no physical addresses, and no shared memory. In a semi-synchronous attack, we extract 96% of an RSA private key from a single trace. We extract the full RSA private key in an automated attack from 11 traces within 5 minutes.

	* Although this method of API obfuscation is relatively old, my friend who was wanting to increase his skills in the Windows sphere confronted me about a way a few malware families seem to resolve APIs. It's pretty simple, however he could not find any documentation with a solid programming example on the matter at the time, so I thought I'd quickly write something up regarding it. I was going to write my own loader for this example (loading the desired module via LdrLoadDll within kernel32.dll, walking the InMemoryOrderModuleList to find the desired loaded module, finding the exported function we're after within the EAT..) - however I thought this might of have been a bit overkill for such a simple concept, I want to cover writing your own PE loader in the future though as it's an interesting subject.

* [Unprotect Project](http://unprotect.tdgt.org/index.php/Unprotect_Project)
	* Malware are one of the most aggressive threats in the IT field. They are often used to cause damage, steal data, or spy on a target. Companies and Security Industry are working to be more effective against this threat and detecting new variants. Malware authors spend a great deal of time and effort to develop complex code to perform malicious actions against a target system. It is crucial for malware to remain undetected and avoid sandbox analysis, antiviruses or malware analysts. With this kind of technics, malware are able to pass under the radar and stay undetected on a system. The purpose of this wiki is to try to centralise all these techniques, to understand and detect new generation of malware.
