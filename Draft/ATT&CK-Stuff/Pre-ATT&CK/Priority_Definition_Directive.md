# Priority Definition Directive


* [Priority Definition Direction - Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Priority_Definition_Direction)
	* Priority definition direction consists of the process of collecting and assigning requirements for meeting Key Intelligence Topics (KIT) or Key Intelligence Questions (KIQ) as determined by leadership. 








-------------------------------
## Assign KITs, KIQs, and/or intelligence requirements
* [Assign KITs, KIQs, and/or intelligence requirements - Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Technique/PRE-T1015)
	* Once generated, Key Intelligence Topics (KITs), Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs), and/or intelligence requirements are assigned to applicable agencies and/or personnel. For example, an adversary may decide nuclear energy requirements should be assigned to a specific organization based on their mission.12 







-------------------------------
## Receive KITs/KIQs and determine requirements
* [Receive KITs/KIQs and determine requirements - Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Technique/PRE-T1016)
	* Applicable agencies and/or personnel receive intelligence requirements and evaluate them to determine sub-requirements related to topics, questions, or requirements. For example, an adversary's nuclear energy requirements may be further divided into nuclear facilities versus nuclear warhead capabilities.

## Submit KITs, KIQs, and intelligence requirements
* [Submit KITs, KIQs, and intelligence requirements - Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Technique/PRE-T1014)
	* Once they have been created, intelligence requirements, Key Intelligence Topics (KITs), and Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs) are submitted into a central management system.



-------------------------------
## Task requirements
* [Task Requirements - Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/pre-attack/index.php/Technique/PRE-T1017)
	* Once divided into the most granular parts, analysts work with collection managers to task the collection management system with requirements and sub-requirements

## Commonly Used Port
* [Commonly Used Port - ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1043)
	* Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend with normal network activity to avoid more detailed inspection.
