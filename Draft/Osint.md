* [Weaponizing Corporate Intel - Mike Felch and Beau Bullock(B-Sides Orlando 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfVXgvABkGg)
	* Strategically targeting a corporation requires deep knowledge of their technologies and employees. Successfully compromising an organization can depend on the quality of reconnaissance a tester performs up front. Often times testers only resort to using publicly available tools which can overlook critical assets.  In this presentation, we will begin by examining some commonly overlooked methods to discover external resources. Next, we will show how to discover employees of a target organization and quickly locate their social media accounts. Finally, we will strategically identify and weaponize personal information about the employees to target the organization directly using new attack techniques. Attendees will learn an external defense evasion method, a new process to gain credentialed access, and be the first to receive a newly released tool!  While the approach is designed to assist offensive security professionals, the presentation will be informative for technical and non-technical audiences; demonstrating the importance of security-awareness for everyone.



* [ODIN](https://github.com/chrismaddalena/ODIN)
	* ODIN aims to automate the basic recon tasks used by red teams to discover and collect data on network assets, including domains, IP addresses, and internet-facing systems. The key feature of ODIN is the data management and reporting. The data is organized in a database and then, optionally, that database can be converted into an HTML report or a Neo4j graph database for visualizing the data.

* [yar](https://github.com/Furduhlutur/yar)
	* yar is an OSINT tool for reconnaissance of repositories/users/organizations on Github. Yar clones repositories of users/organizations given to it and goes through the whole commit history in order of commit time, in search for secrets/tokens/passwords, essentially anything that shouldn't be there. Whenever yar finds a secret, it will print it out for you to further assess. Yar searches either by regex, entropy or both, the choice is yours. You can think of yar as a bigger and better truffleHog, it does everything that truffleHog does and more!

		* Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.

		* **Certificate Transparency**
			* [ct-exposer](https://github.com/chris408/ct-exposer)
			    * An OSINT tool that discovers sub-domains by searching Certificate Transparency logs. Certificate Transparency (CT) is an experimental IETF standard. The goal of it was to allow the public to audit which certificates were created by Certificate Authorities (CA). TLS has a weakness that comes from the large list of CAs that your browser implicitly trusts. If any of those CAs were to maliciously create a new certificate for a domain, your browser would trust it. CT adds benefits to TLS certificate trust: Companies can monitor who is creating certificates for the domains they own. It also allows browsers to verify that the certificate for a given domain is in the public log record. These logs end up being a gold mine of information for penetration testers and red teams.
