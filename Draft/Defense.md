				* With the adoption of endpoint detection and response tools as well as a higher focus on behavior detection within organizations, when simulating an adversary it's important to understand the systems you are targeting. This talk will focus on the next evolution of red teaming and how defeating defenders will take more work and effort. This is a good thing! It's also proof that working together (red and blue) collectively, we can make our security programs more robust in defending against attacks. This talk will dive into actual simulations where defenders have caught us as well as ways that we have circumvented even some of the best detection programs out there today. Let's dive into baselining behavior and refining our tradecraft to evade detection and how we can use that to make blue better.

To achieve our mission, we invested in our cartography capabilities that aim at keeping track of our assets but most importantly, the relationship and interaction between them. The talk provides insight on an intelligence service solution implemented by Lyft Security Intelligence team to tackle knowledge consolidation and improve decision making. Attendees of this session will be introduced to the platform we implemented along with a broad set of scenarios that allow us to burndown security debt, detect assumptions drift, and enable teams to explore their service and environment. Furthermore, Lyft will release the platform to the open source community as part of the conference and provide details on how it can be extended to adapt to each need.

			* Over the last decade, there has been steady growth in the adoption of open-source components in modern web applications.

			*  Enterprise networks are often complex, hard to understand, and worst of all - undocumented. Few organizations have network diagrams and asset management systems and even fewer organizations have those that are effective and up to date. Leveraging an organization's SIEM or logging solution, network diagrams and asset inventories can be extrapolated from this data through the 'gravity' of the network. Similar to our solar system and galaxy, even if you cannot confirm or physically see an object, you can measure the forces of gravity it exerts on the observable objects around it that we do know about. For example, unconfirmed endpoints can be enumerated by the authentication activity they register on known domain controllers. The inferred list of endpoints and their network addresses can begin to map out logical networks. The unpolished list of logical networks can be mapped against known egress points to identify physical networks and potentially identify undiscovered egress points and the technologies that exist at the egress points. As more objects are extrapolated and inferred, the more accurate the model of your enterprise network will become. Through this iterative and repeatable process, network diagrams and asset inventories can be drafted, further explored, refined, and ultimately managed. Even the weakest of observable forces can create fingerprints that security professionals can leverage to more effectively become guardians of the galaxy.

			* Have you ever wondered why one of your high-priority vulnerabilities got rejected or delayed even though you thought it was foolish of your company not to implement it in a timely fashion? You probably got slowed down or stopped by the gatekeepers to engineering resources namely product management. However, what product management entails and what the goals of product management are, is rarely explained. I lead a group of product managers in a medical software company, and it is my job to decide which projects make it into the engineering/R&D backlog and which ones are being delayed or even eliminated. I will share the decision-making process and critical questions that need to be answered by any project to make it onto the shortlist. In this presentation, I will provide a view of product management from the inside. Once everybody understands what product management is, what product managers do, why he or she does it, and what his or her decision process is, we can improve the chances of critical IT projects or vulnerability fixes to be completed on time. I believe that together we can build better and more secure products when we understand each other's motivators and goals.

			* To summarize, in this talk we will discuss the pain points that most organizations face in getting traction to vulnerability remediation, how we decided to tackle the challenge, the solution we built and how we drove accountability to improve metrics. We will talk about the key decisions we made that the audience can relate to and improve their own vulnerability management program. Finally, we will show templates of our Jira boards, metrics and charts that helped in measuring success of the program.

Weather it's to avoid paying high costs for "enterprise" level solutions, prototype new concepts, or simply "glue" solutions together that are otherwise not designed to play well with others, the accomplished attacker is also a tool smith. "What about the blue team!?" This talk aims to address just that by providing practical solutions to defender tasks that include but are not limited to: IPS/IDS, malware detection and defense, forensics, system hardening, and practical and expedient reverse engineering techniques.
	* [Using an Expanded Cyber Kill Chain Model to Increase Attack Resiliency - Sean Malone - BHUSA16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Dz12M7u-S8)
		* We'll review what actions are taken in each phase, and what's necessary for the adversary to move from one phase to the next. We'll discuss multiple types of controls that you can implement today in your enterprise to frustrate the adversary's plan at each stage, to avoid needing to declare "game over" just because an adversary has gained access to the internal network. The primary limiting factor of the traditional Cyber Kill Chain is that it ends with Stage 7: Actions on Objectives, conveying that once the adversary reaches this stage and has access to a system on the internal network, the defending victim has already lost. In reality, there should be multiple layers of security zones on the internal network, to protect the most critical assets. The adversary often has to move through numerous additional phases in order to access and manipulate specific systems to achieve his objective. By increasing the time and effort required to move through these stages, we decrease the likelihood of the adversary causing material damage to the enterprise.

How many products have you seen half-implemented (but fully paid for!) that didn’t ever deliver any real value to your organization? Here, I’ll discuss multiple free products that you can use next week to find evil inside your organization. Some techniques will find less advanced adversaries, and some will trip up even some of the most advanced ones - but they’ll all deliver value in less than a week of implementation, and I’ll discuss how you can integrate them and find the malware you already have in your environment. “Assume breach”...then find it!

		* [You're Leaking Trade Secrets - Defcon22 Michael Schrenk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd5TL6_zgY)
			* Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.
	* **Tools**	
		* [AIL framework - Analysis Information Leak framework](https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework)
			* AIL is a modular framework to analyse potential information leaks from unstructured data sources like pastes from Pastebin or similar services or unstructured data streams. AIL framework is flexible and can be extended to support other functionalities to mine sensitive information.
