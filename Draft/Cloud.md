It allows users to define policies to enable a well managed cloud infrastructure, that's both secure and cost optimized. It consolidates many of the adhoc scripts organizations have into a lightweight and flexible tool, with unified metrics and reporting. Custodian can be used to manage AWS, Azure, and GCP environments by ensuring real time compliance to security policies (like encryption and access requirements), tag policies, and cost management via garbage collection of unused resources and off-hours resource management. Custodian policies are written in simple YAML configuration files that enable users to specify policies on a resource type (EC2, ASG, Redshift, CosmosDB, PubSub Topic) and are constructed from a vocabulary of filters and actions. It integrates with the cloud native serverless capabilities of each provider to provide for real time enforcement of policies with builtin provisioning. Or it can be run as a simple cron job on a server to execute against large existing fleets.

		* Taking on the viewpoint of a serverless customer, we conduct the largest measurement study to date, launching more than 50,000 function instances across these three services, in order to characterize their architectures, performance, and resource management efficiency. We explain how the platforms isolate the functions of different accounts, using either virtual machines or containers, which has important security implications. We characterize performance in terms of scalability, coldstart latency, and resource efficiency, with highlights including that AWS Lambda adopts a bin-packing-like strategy to maximize VM memory utilization, that severe contention between functions can arise in AWS and Azure, and that Google had bugs that allow customers to use resources for free.

		* BHIS made some interesting discoveries while working with a customer to audit their Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. At the time of the discovery, we found two paths to ingress the customer’s virtual private cloud (VPC) through the elastic map reduce (EMR) application stacks. One of the vulns that gained us internal access was the Hadoop Unauthenticated RCE, which was patched by Apache a while back now. Another, and a bit more interesting entry point, was the HUE interface, which, by default, allows the creation of a new admin user for the web interface. Once in the web interface, HUE is similar to Jupyter in that it helps visualize code flow and operations. Here, you can create schedules that will send egress shells from the cluster worker nodes. Which, consequently, provides a window to a virtual private cloud network.

			* This python script lists all the main resources of your AWS account. This inventory may be uncomplete, but it should help you to find what I call "main" resources that are, in my mind, resources that should affect billing and/or security. Intended for personal use (even if I added some professional features like logging), and for only one account.
		* [clinv](https://github.com/lyz-code/clinv)
			* command line inventory for DevSecOps resources in AWS.
		* [aws-inventory(NCCGroup)](https://github.com/nccgroup/aws-inventory)
			* This is a tool that tries to discover all AWS resources created in an account. AWS has many products (a.k.a. services) with new ones constantly being added and existing ones expanded with new features. The ecosystem allows users to piece together many different services to form a customized cloud experience. The ability to instantly spin up services at scale comes with a manageability cost. It can quickly become difficult to audit an AWS account for the resources being used. It is not only important for billing purposes, but also for security. Dormant resources and unknown resources are more prone to security configuration weaknesses. Additionally, resources with unexpected dependencies pose availability, access control, and authorization issues.
		* [resource-counter](https://github.com/disruptops/resource-counter)
			* This command line tool counts the number of resources in different categories across Amazon regions. This is a simple Python app that will count resources across different regions and display them on the command line. It first shows the dictionary of the results for the monitored services on a per-region basis, then it shows totals across all regions in a friendlier format. It tries to use the most-efficient query mechanism for each resource in order to manage the impact of API activity. I wrote this to help me scope out assessments and know where resources are in a target account.
		* [antiope](https://github.com/turnerlabs/antiope)
			* AWS Inventory and Compliance Framework - intended to be an open sourced framework for managing resources across hundreds of AWS Accounts.

			* Script to scan for buckets with given creds
		* [BuQuikker](https://github.com/Quikko/BuQuikker)
			* This project is intended to show how easy it is to find poorly configured AWS buckets. This project is build on top of bucketeer. It should make the life of a bugbounty hunter much easier. The user needs to provide a list and each word in the list will be used in combination with the teh_s3_bucketeers script. Whenever the script finds an open bucket, the teh_s3_bucketeers script will write it into `result-<name-of-searchword>.txt`
		* [Bucket Stream](https://github.com/eth0izzle/bucket-stream)
			* This tool simply listens to various certificate transparency logs (via certstream) and attempts to find public S3 buckets from permutations of the certificates domain name.

			* Enumerates S3 buckets manually or via certstream
		* [s3finder](https://github.com/magisterquis/s3finder)
			* Yet another program to find readable S3 buckets. Can search using a wordlist or by monitoring the certstream network for domain names from certificate transparency logs. If a name contains dots, a name with the dots replaced by dashes will be tried, as well. All queries are done via HTTPS. Found buckets will be written to stdout. All other messages are written to stderr, to make for easy logging.
		* [S3scan](https://github.com/abhn/S3Scan)
			 * A simple script to find open Amazon AWS S3 buckets in your target websites. S3 buckets are a popular way of storing static contents among web developers. Often, developers tend to set the bucket permissions insecurely during development, and forget to set them correctly in prod, leading to (security) issues.
