			* Many struggle in their job with the decision of what events to log in battle against costly increases to their licensing of a commercial SIEM or other logging solution. Leveraging the open source solutions used for "big-data" that have been proven by many can help build a scalable, reliable, and hackable event logging and security intelligence system to address security and (*cringe*) compliance requirements. We’ll walk through the various components and simple steps to building your own logging environment that can extensively grow (or keep sized just right) with just additional hardware cost and show numerous examples you can implement as soon as you get back to work (or home).

			* [Getting Cozy With OpenBSM Auditing On MacOS - Patrick Wardle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqlpJ7rIT6M)
				* With the demise of dtrace on macOS, and Apple’s push to rid the kernel of 3rd-party kexts, another option is needed to perform effective auditing on macOS. Lucky for us, OpenBSM fits the bill. Though quite powerful, this auditing mechanism is rather poorly documented and suffered from a variety of kernel vulnerabilities. In this talk, we’ll begin with an introductory overview of OpenBSM’s goals, capabilities, and components before going ‘behind-the-scenes’ to take a closer look at it’s kernel-mode implementation. Armed with this understanding, we’ll then detail exactly how to build powerful user-mode macOS monitoring utilities such as file, process, and networking monitors based on the OpenBSM framework and APIs. Next we’ll don our hacker hats and discuss a handful of kernel bugs discovered during a previous audit of the audit subsystem (yes, quite meta): a subtle off-by-one read error, a blotched patch that turned the off-by-one into a kernel info leak, and finally an exploitable heap overflow. Though now patched, the discussion of these bugs provides an interesting ‘case-study’ of finding and exploiting several types of bugs that lurked within the macOS kernel for many years

				* This document has been developed as a guide to the setup and configuration of Windows event logging and forwarding. This advice has been developed to support both the detection and investigation of malicious activity by providing an ideal balance between the collection of important events and management of data volumes. This advice is also designed to complement existing host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems.  This document is intended for information technology and information security professionals. It covers the types of events which can be generated and an assessment of their relative value, centralised collection of event logs, the retention of event logs, and recommended Group Policy settings along with implementation notes.

			* [Windows Event Forwarding Guidance - Palantir](https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding) 
				* Over the past few years, Palantir has a maintained an internal Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) pipeline for generating and centrally collecting logs of forensic and security value from Microsoft Windows hosts. Once these events are collected and indexed, alerting and detection strategies (ADS) can be constructed not only on high-fidelity security events (e.g. log deletion), but also for deviations from normalcy, such as unusual service account access, access to sensitive filesystem or registry locations, or installation of malware persistence. The goal of this project is to provide the necessary building blocks for organizations to rapidly evaluate and deploy WEF to a production environment, and centralize public efforts to improve WEF subscriptions and encourage adoption. While WEF has become more popular in recent years, it is still dramatically underrepresented in the community, and it is our hope that this project may encourage others to adopt it for incident detection and response purposes. We acknowledge the efforts that Microsoft, IAD, and other contributors have made to this space and wish to thank them for providing many of the subscriptions, ideas, and techniques that will be covered in this post.

				* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it-s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What-s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."

			* [ETW - Monitor Anything, Anytime, Anywhere - Dina Goldshtein(NDC Oslo 2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNdpLM4uIpw)
				* You’ll learn how to diagnose incredibly complex issues in production systems such as excessive garbage collection pauses, slow startup due to JIT and disk accesses, and even sluggishness during the Windows boot process. We will also explore some ways to automate ETW collection and analysis to build self-diagnosing applications that identify high CPU issues, resource leaks, and concurrency problems and produce alerts and reports. In the course of the talk we will use innovative performance tools that haven’t been applied to ETW before — flame graphs for visualising call stacks and a command-line interface for dynamic, scriptable ETW tracing. ETW is truly a window into everything happening on your system, and it doesn’t require expensive licenses, invasive tools, or modifying your code in any way. It is a critical, first-stop skill on your way to mastering application performance and diagnostics.

You can view this log in Event Viewer or by using cmdlets that get events, such as the Get-EventLog cmdlet. By default, Windows PowerShell engine and provider events are recorded in the event log, but you can use the event log preference variables to customize the event log. For example, you can add events about Windows PowerShell commands.

While this provides tremendous value for most of today’s PowerShell attacks, I will introduce over a dozen obfuscation techniques that render today’s detection techniques grossly ineffective. These techniques will enable the innovative Red Team to continue using PowerShell undetected while challenging the Blue Team to identify these attacks more effectively. Finally, I will unveil Invoke-Obfuscation.ps1 which will enable both Red and Blue Teams to effortlessly create highly obfuscated PowerShell commands so organizations can test their detection capabilities against these obfuscation techniques."

				* Attackers, administrators and many legitimate products rely on PowerShell for their core functionality. However, being a Windows-signed binary native on Windows 7 and later that enables reflective injection of binaries and DLLs and memory-resident execution of remotely hosted scripts, has made it increasingly attractive for attackers and commodity malware authors alike. In environments where PowerShell is heavily used, filtering out legitimate activity to detect malicious PowerShell usage is not trivial.

In addition to diving deep into the mechanics of each malicious example, this presentation will highlight forensic artifacts, detection approaches and the deep visibility that the latest versions of PowerShell provides security practitioners to defend their organizations against the latest attacks that utilize PowerShell. So if you are new to security or just want to learn about how attackers have used PowerShell in their attacks, then this talk is for you. If you want to see what obfuscated and multi-stage, evasive PowerShell-based attacks look like under the microscope of PowerShell deep inspection capabilities, this talk is for you. And if you want to see why these security advancements to PowerShell are causing many attackers to shift their tradecraft development away from PowerShell, this talk is for you."

			* Network Intrusion Prevention Systems or NIPS have been plagued by "False Positive" issues almost since their first deployment. A "False Positive" could simply be described as incorrectly or mistakenly detecting a threat that is not real. A large amount of research has gone into using "False Positive" as an attack vector either to attack the very validity of an IPS system or to conduct forms of Denial of Service attacks. However the very reaction to a "False Positive" in the first place may very well reveal more detailed information about defences than you might well think.

		* [Sigma - Generic Signatures for Log Events - Thomas Patzke(Hack.lu2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheVuE9Ifhs)
			* Log files are a great resource for hunting threats and analysis of incidents. Unfortunately, there is no standardized signature format like YARA for files or Snort signatures for network traffic. This makes sharing of log signatures by security researchers and software developers problematic. Further, most SIEM systems have their own query language, which makes signature distribution in large heterogeneous environments inefficient and increases costs for replacement of SIEM solutions.Sigma tries to fill these gaps by providing a YAML-based format for log signatures, an open repository of signatures and an extensible tool that converts Sigma signatures into different query languages. Rules and tools were released as open source and are actively developed. This presentation gives an overview about use cases, Sigma rules and the conversion tool, the development community and future plans of the project.

				* NetworkMiner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for Windows (but also works in Linux / Mac OS X / FreeBSD). NetworkMiner can be used as a passive network sniffer/packet capturing tool in order to detect operating systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files.
			* **SilLK**	
				* [Silk](https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/)
					* The SiLK analysis suite is a collection of command-line tools for processing SiLK Flow records created by the SiLK packing system. These tools read binary files containing SiLK Flow records and partition, sort, and count these records. The most important analysis tool is rwfilter, an application for querying the central data repository for SiLK Flow records that satisfy a set of filtering options. The tools are intended to be combined in various ways to perform an analysis task. A typical analysis uses UNIX pipes and intermediate data files to share data between invocations of the tools.

		* **ShellCode Analysis**
			* [Shellcode Analysis Pipeline](https://7h3ram.github.io/2014/3/18/shellcode-pipeline/)
				* I recently required an automated way of analyzing shellcode and verifying if it is detected by Libemu, Snort, Suricata, Bro, etc. Shellcode had to come from public sources like Shell-Storm, Exploit-DB and Metasploit. I needed an automated way of sourcing shellcode from these projects and pass it on to the analysis engines in a pipeline-like mechanism. This posts documents the method I used to complete this task and the overall progress of the project.

		* [Monitoring Ephemeral Infrastructure with osquery - Matt Jane(Querycon219)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03tCsq-vDbA)
			* Modern infrastructure and deployment methods, as well as web-scale infrastructure have brought about a new paradigm in infrastructure management. Short lived and ephemeral resources allow applications to scale up and down on demand. Unfortunately this means that one of the primary information gather methods of osquery, scheduled queries, becomes far less useful if queries are scheduled for a longer interval than the infrastructure will exist. This doesn’t mean osquery and scheduled queries are no longer useful, far from it. It simply means that we need to adjust our way of thinking a bit and adapt our methods of information gathering to overcome these new issues.

			* This talk introduces security event monitoring on Linux, and our lessons learned from attempts to implement it within osquery. Our first experience with osquery event monitoring was rewriting its use of Auditd. In order to capture events within containers, we next implemented an event publisher based on eBPF. We discovered what works, what doesn’t, and some paths forward.

To make these concepts as consumable as possible, we are focusing the entire series around Kerberoasting. Focusing on this technique allows readers to focus on the strategies presented in each article instead of worrying about the details of the technique itself. The focus of this post is a concept we call “capability abstraction.” The idea is that an attacker’s tools are merely an abstraction of their attack capabilities, and detection engineers must understand how to evaluate abstraction while building detection logic.

			* Signatures are dead, or so we're told. It's true that many items that are shared as Indicators of Compromise (file names/paths/sizes/hashes and network IPs/domains) are no longer effective. These rigid indicators break at the first attempt at evasion. Creating resilient detections that stand up to evasion attempts by dedicated attackers and researchers is challenging, but is possible with the right tools, visibility and methodical (read iterative) approach.   As part of FireEye's Advanced Practices Team, we are tasked with creating resilient, high-fidelity detections that run across hundreds of environments and millions of endpoints. In this talk we will share insights on our processes and approaches to detection development, including practical examples derived from real-world attacks.

			* Traditionally, the answer to this question has been to execute an attack technique in a controlled environment and to observe relevant events that surface. While this approach may suffice in some cases, ask yourself the following questions: ?Will this scale? Will this detect current/future variants of the technique? Is this resilient to bypass?? If your confidence level in answering these questions is not high, it?s time to consider a more mature methodology for identifying detection data sources. With a little bit of reverse engineering, a defender can unlock a multitude of otherwise unknown telemetry. This talk will establish a methodology for identifying detection data sources and will cover concepts including Event Tracing for Windows, WPP, TraceLogging, and security product analysis.

Threat hunting is one of the ways in which organizations can proactively look for threats. This talk would discuss the fundamentals of threat hunting, what the hunting teams should look for and how to collect and analyze relevant data. We will discuss some of the recipes to perform threat hunting.

			* Threat hunting is a proactive and iterative approach to detecting threats. Although threat hunters should rely heavily on automation and machine assistance, the process itself cannot be fully automated. One of the human’s key contributions to a hunt is the formulation of a hypotheses to guide the hunt. This paper explores three types of hypotheses and outlines how and when to formulate each of them.

			* Data stacking is the application of frequency analysis to large volumes of similar data in an effort to isolate and identify anomalies. In short, data stacking is an investigative technique that can be used to find a needle in a digital haystack. It involves an iterative process of reducing large amounts of data into manageable chunks that can be consumed and investigated.

				* Enabling the correct endpoint logging and centralizing the collection of different data sources has finally become a basic security standard. This allows organizations to not just increase the level of visibility, but to enhance their threat detection. Solutions such as an (Elastic) ELK stack have largely been adopted by small and large organizations for data ingestion, storage and visualization. Although, it might seem that collecting a massive amount of data is all analysts need to do their jobs, there are several challenges for them when faced with large, unstructured and often incomplete/disparate data sets. In addition to the sisyphean task of detecting and responding to adversaries there may be pitfalls with organizational funding, support, and or approval (Government). Although “everyone” is collecting logs and despite the many challenges, we will show you how to make sense of these logs in an efficient and consistent way. Specifically when it comes to Windows Event logs (ie: Sysmon, PowerShell, etc) and the ability to map fields to other logs such as Bro NSM or some other network monitoring/prevention device. This will include different Windows Event log data normalization techniques across the 1,000+ unique Event IDs and its 3,000+ unique fields. Also, proven data normalization techniques such as hashing fields/values for logs such as PowerShell, Scheduled Tasks, Command Line, and more. These implementations will show how it allows an analyst to efficiently “pivot” from an endpoint log to a NSM log or a device configuration change log. However, we will also show how an analyst can make an informed decision without degrading/hindering their investigation as well as to enhance their decision. Whether this is preventing an analyst from excluding keywords that a malicious actor may include as an “evasion” technique or adding additional analysis techniques (ie: graphing).

			* In this talk, we’ll explain some of the technical concepts of threat hunting. We will be looking at what is beyond traditional signature detection – the likes of AV, IPS/IDS and SIEMs, which in our experience are ineffective – and detailing some of the ways you can catch real attackers in the act. As a case study, we’ll look at some of the specifics of common attack frameworks - the likes of Metasploit and Powershell Empire - walking through an example attack, and showing how they can be detected. From large-scale process monitoring to live memory analysis and anomaly detection techniques, we will cover some of the technical quirks when it comes to effective attack detection.

			* Memhunter is an endpoint sensor tool that is specialized in detecing resident malware, improving the threat hunter analysis process and remediation times. The tool detects and reports memory-resident malware living on endpoint processes. Memhunter detects known malicious memory injection techniques. The detection process is performed through live analysis and without needing memory dumps. The tool was designed as a replacement of memory forensic volatility plugins such as malfind and hollowfind. The idea of not requiring memory dumps helps on performing the memory resident malware threat hunting at scale, without manual analysis, and without the complex infrastructure needed to move dumps to forensic environments. Besides the data collection and hunting heuristics, the project has also led to the creation of a companion tool called "minjector" that contains +15 code injection techniques. The minjector tool cannot onlybe used to exercise memhunter detections, but also as a one-stop location to learn on well-known code injection techniques out there.

			* Enterprise networks are often complex, hard to understand, and worst of all - undocumented. Few organizations have network diagrams and asset management systems and even fewer organizations have those that are effective and up to date. Leveraging an organization's SIEM or logging solution, network diagrams and asset inventories can be extrapolated from this data through the 'gravity' of the network. Similar to our solar system and galaxy, even if you cannot confirm or physically see an object, you can measure the forces of gravity it exerts on the observable objects around it that we do know about. For example, unconfirmed endpoints can be enumerated by the authentication activity they register on known domain controllers. The inferred list of endpoints and their network addresses can begin to map out logical networks. The unpolished list of logical networks can be mapped against known egress points to identify physical networks and potentially identify undiscovered egress points and the technologies that exist at the egress points. As more objects are extrapolated and inferred, the more accurate the model of your enterprise network will become. Through this iterative and repeatable process, network diagrams and asset inventories can be drafted, further explored, refined, and ultimately managed. Even the weakest of observable forces can create fingerprints that security professionals can leverage to more effectively become guardians of the galaxy.

			* In this paper, we present the first systematic study on thisnew trend of BPH services. By collecting and analyzing a large amount of data (25 Whois snapshots of the entire IPv4 addressspace, 1.5 TB of passive DNS data, and longitudinal data fromseveral blacklist feeds), we are able to identify a set of newfeatures that uniquely characterizes BPH on sub-allocations and are costly to evade. Based upon these features, we train a classifierfor detecting malicious sub-allocated network blocks, achieving a 98% recall and 1.5% false discovery rates according to our evaluation. Using a conservatively trained version of our classifier,we scan the whole IPv4 address space and detect 39K malicious network blocks. This allows us to perform a large-scale study ofthe BPH service ecosystem, which sheds light on this underground business strategy, including patterns of network blocks being recycled and malicious clients migrating to different network blocks, in an effort to evade IP address based blacklisting. Our study highlights the trend of agile BPH services and points to potential methods of detecting and mitigating this emerging threat.

		* Multiple methods exist for detecting malicious activity in a network, including intrusion detection, anti-virus, and log analysis. However, the majority of these use signatures, looking for already known events and they typically require some level of human intervention and maintenance. Using behavioral analysis methods, it may be possible to observe and create a baseline of average behavior on a network, enabling intelligent notification of anomalous activity. This talk will demonstrate methods of performing this activity in different environments. Attendees will learn new methods which they can apply to further monitor and secure their networks

				* Attacks are rarely detected even after months of activity. What are defenders missing and how could an attack by detected? This talk covers effective methods to detect attacker activity using the features built into Windows and how to optimize a detection strategy. The primary focus is on what knobs can be turned and what buttons can be pushed to better detect attacks. One of the latest tools in the offensive toolkit is ""Kerberoast"" which involves cracking service account passwords offline without admin rights. This attack technique is covered at length including the latest methods to extract and crack the passwords. Furthermore, this talk describes a new detection method the presenter developed. The attacker's playbook evolves quickly, defenders need to stay up to speed on the latest attack methods and ways to detect them. This presentation will help you better understand what events really matter and how to better leverage Windows features to track, limit, and detect attacks.

			* [What Event Logs? Part 1: Attacker Tricks to Remove Event Logs - Matt Bromiley(SANS DFIR 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JIftAw8wQY)
				* In part 1 of this series, SANS instructor and incident responder Matt Bromiley focuses on techniques, old and new, that attackers are using to neutralize event logs as a recording mechanism. Ranging from clearing of logs to surgical, specific event removal, in this webcast we will discuss how the attackers are doing what they're doing, and the forensic techniques we can use to detect their methods. There has been a lot of discussions lately about attackers' ability to fool the system into not writing event logs - but are our attackers truly staying hidden when they do this? Let's find out!
			* [What Event Logs Part 2 Lateral Movement without Event Logs - Matt Bromiley(SANS DFIR 2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8ybADELHzk)
				* In part 2 of this series, SANS instructor and incident responder Matt Bromiley will discuss techniques to identify lateral movement when Windows Event Logs are not present. Sometimes logs roll without preservation, and sometimes attackers remove them from infected systems. Despite this, there are still multiple artifacts we can rely on to identify where our attackers came from, and where they went. In this webcast, we'll discuss the techniques and artifacts to identify this activity.

Currently, the only implemented hook is on the native LoadImage() function. When events are observed, they are sent over a named pipe to a monitoring process for further introspection and mitigation decision.

In this talk, I discuss ways that an attacker who has obtained domain administrator privileges can extend, persist, and maintain control, as well as how a forensic examiner or incident responder could detect these activities and root out an attacker.

We cover overall strategies for implementation and how to deploy them via Group Policy. We walk through a basic sample of malware and show how both of these technologies react to it. Finally, we cover a couple of different "bypass" techniques for each. Everything in security has weaknesses, and these two technologies are no exception.

I will explain the pain of lacking visibility in a common Enterprise environment. I will present my hunting app, which contains over 150 searches and over 15 dashboards. Knowledge is power; The workflow has been intentionally built on generic searches to cover all attack variations, to be able to uncover most potentially malicious behaviour. The dashboards contain overviews, threat indicators and facilitate consecutive drilldown workflows to help the analyst determine whether this is a threat or not and allow them to whitelist.
