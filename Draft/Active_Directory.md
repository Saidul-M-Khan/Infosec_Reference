			* Active Directory (AD) is leveraged by 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies for its directory, authentication, and management capabilities. This means tSMBhat both Red and Blue teams need to have a better understanding of Active Directory, it's security, how it's attacked, and how best to align defenses. This presentation covers key Active Directory components which are critical for security professionals to know in order to defend AD. Properly securing the enterprise means identifying and leveraging appropriate defensive technologies. The provided information is immediately useful and actionable in order to help organizations better secure their enterprise resources against attackers. Highlighted are areas attackers go after including some recently patched vulnerabilities and the exploited weaknesses. This includes the critical Kerberos vulnerability (MS14-068), Group Policy Man-in-the-Middle (MS15-011 & MS15-014) and how they take advantages of AD communication.

				* Windows APIs are often a blackbox with poor documentation, taking input and spewing output with little visibility on what actually happens in the background. By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques. In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing 0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

				* Kerberos “Golden Tickets” were unveiled by Alva “Skip” Duckwall & Benjamin Delpy in 2014 during their Black Hat USA presentation. Around this time, Active Directory (AD) admins all over the world felt a great disturbance in the Force. Golden Tickets are the ultimate method for persistent, forever AD admin rights to a network since they are valid Kerberos tickets and can’t be detected, right? This talk explores the latest Active Directory attack vectors and describes how Golden Ticket usage can be detected. When forged Kerberos tickets are used in AD, there are some interesting artifacts that can be identified. Yes, despite what you may have read on the internet, there are ways to detect Golden & Silver Ticket usage. Skip the fluff and dive right into the technical detail describing the latest methods for gaining and maintaining administrative access in Active Directory, including some sneaky AD persistence methods. Also covered are traditional security measures that work (and ones that don’t) as well as the mitigation strategies that disrupts the attacker’s preferred game-plan. Prepare to go beyond “Pass-the-Hash” and down the rabbit hole.
			* [Red Vs. Blue: Modern Active Directory Attacks, Detection, And Protection - Sean Metcalf(BHUSA15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6GUXerE9Ac)
				* Kerberos "Golden Tickets" were unveiled by Alva "Skip" Duckwall & Benjamin Delpy in 2014 during their Black Hat USA presentation. Around this time, Active Directory (AD) admins all over the world felt a great disturbance in the Force. Golden Tickets are the ultimate method for persistent, forever AD admin rights to a network since they are valid Kerberos tickets and can't be detected, right? The news is filled with reports of breached companies and government agencies with little detail on the attack vectors and mitigation. This briefing discusses in detail the latest attack methods for gaining and maintaining administrative access in Active Directory. Also covered are traditional defensive security measures that work (and ones that don't) as well as the mitigation strategies that can keep your company's name off the front page. Prepare to go beyond "Pass-the-Hash" and down the rabbit hole. This talk explores the latest Active Directory attack vectors and describes how Golden Ticket usage can be detected.

			* [Beyond the MCSE: Red Teaming Active Directory - Sean Metcalf(Defcon24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfwmReo1Hk)
				* Active Directory (AD) is leveraged by 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies for its directory, authentication, and management capabilities, so why do red teams barely scratch the surface when it comes to leveraging the data it contains? This talk skips over the standard intro to Active Directory fluff and dives right into the compelling offensive information useful to a Red Teamer, such as quickly identifying target systems and accounts. AD can yield a wealth of information if you know the right questions to ask. This presentation ventures into areas many didn't know existed and leverages capability to quietly identify interesting accounts & systems, identify organizations the target company does business with regularly, build target lists without making a sound, abuse misconfigurations/existing trusts, and quickly discover the most interesting shares and their location. PowerShell examples and AD defense evasion techniques are provided throughout the talk.Let's go beyond the MCSE and take a different perspective on the standard AD recon and attack tactics.

				* Tim and Mike will show you tools and techniques to find vulnerabilities and demonstrate risk, without using Domain Administrator (DA) access. DA access is the goal for many penetration tests and red teams, but it is misguided. DA is a tool, not a destination. Sometimes, a penetration tester or red team will be unable to obtain this access, but it does not mean that the test is without value.

Not Only User account Name is fetched, but also users OU path and Computer Accounts are retrieved. You can also list the history of last logged on users. In Environment where Exchange Servers are used, the exchange servers authentication request for users will also be logged since it also uses EventID (4768) to for TGT Request.

				* Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) has become increasingly popular in the last few years. As a penetration tester, I'm seeing organizations opening themselves up to attacks on ADFS endpoints across the Internet. Manually completing attacks against these endpoints can be tedious. The current native Microsoft management tools are handy, but what if we weaponized them. During this talk, I will show you how to identify domains that support ADFS, confirm email addresses for users of the domain, and help you guess passwords for those users. We'll cover how you can set up your own hosted ADFS domain (on the cheap), and use it to attack other federated domains. On top of that, we'll show you how you can wrap all of the native functionality with PowerShell to automate your attacks. This talk should give penetration testers an overview on how they can start leveraging ADFS endpoints during a penetration test.

			    * During internal penetration tests, it happens quite often that we manage to obtain Domain Administrative access within a few hours. Contributing to this are insufficient system hardening and the use of insecure Active Directory defaults. In such scenarios publicly available tools help in finding and exploiting these issues and often result in obtaining domain administrative privileges. This blogpost describes a scenario where our standard attack methods did not work and where we had to dig deeper in order to gain high privileges in the domain. We describe more advanced privilege escalation attacks using Access Control Lists and introduce a new tool called Invoke-Aclpwn and an extension to ntlmrelayx that automate the steps for this advanced attack.

				* In my [last post](https://rohnspowershellblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/viewing-service-acls/), I showed an early version of a function to get the Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) of a Windows service. In this post, I’m going to show a newer version of that function, along with a function to change the DACL, and a helper function to create Access Control Entries (ACEs). The source code is quite a bit longer, so I’m not going to walk through each bit of code. What I will do is give a brief overview of each of the three functions, along with some examples of how to use them. I’ll also mention where I plan to take the functions in the future. I’ll include the source code of the functions as they currently stand at the end of the post. Included in the source code is comment based help for each of the three functions.

Note: to implement these backdoors, you need the right to change the security descriptor information for the targeted service, which in stock configurations nearly always means membership in the local administrators group.

They require an insecurely configured DNS server that allows anonymous users to transfer all records and gather information about host in the network. What not many people know however is that if Active Directory integrated DNS is used, any user can query all the DNS records by default. This blog introduces a tool to do this and describes a method to do this even for records normal users don’t have read rights for.

				* Grouper2 is a tool for pentesters to help find security-related misconfigurations in Active Directory Group Policy. It might also be useful for other people doing other stuff, but it is explicitly NOT meant to be an audit tool. If you want to check your policy configs against some particular standard, you probably want Microsoft's Security and Compliance Toolkit, not Grouper or Grouper2.

				* Kerberos- besides having three heads and guarding the gates of hell- protects services on Microsoft Windows Domains. Its use is increasing due to the growing number of attacks targeting NTLM authentication. Attacking Kerberos to access Windows resources represents the next generation of attacks on Windows authentication.In this talk Tim will discuss his research on new attacks against Kerberos- including a way to attack the credentials of a remote service without sending traffic to the service as well as rewriting tickets to access systems.He will also examine potential countermeasures against Kerberos attacks with suggestions for mitigating the most common weaknesses in Windows Kerberos deployments.

The problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket- Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately- we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

				* You don’t need Windows to talk to Windows. This talk will explain and walk through various techniques to (ab)use LDAP and Kerberos from non-Windows machines to perform reconnaissance, gain footholds, and maintain persistence, with an emphasis on explaining how the attacks and protocols work. This talk will walk through some lesser known tools and techniques for doing reconnaissance and enumeration in AD environments, as well as gaining an initial foothold, and using credentials in different, stealthier ways (i.e. Kerberos). While tools like Bloodhound, CrackMapExec and Deathstar have made footholds and paths to DA very easy and automated, this talk will instead discuss how tools like this work “under-the-hood” and will stress living off the land with default tools and manual recon and exploitation. After discussing some of the technologies and protocols that make up Active Directory Domain Services, I’ll explain how to interact with these using Linux tools and Python. You don’t need a Windows foothold to talk Windows - everything will be done straight from Linux using DNS, LDAP, Heimdal Kerberos, Samba and Python Impacket.
		* **Tools**
			* [LDAPDomainDump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)
				* In an Active Directory domain, a lot of interesting information can be retrieved via LDAP by any authenticated user (or machine). This makes LDAP an interesting protocol for gathering information in the recon phase of a pentest of an internal network. A problem is that data from LDAP often is not available in an easy to read format. ldapdomaindump is a tool which aims to solve this problem, by collecting and parsing information available via LDAP and outputting it in a human readable HTML format, as well as machine readable json and csv/tsv/greppable files.
			* [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch)
				* windapsearch is a Python script to help enumerate users, groups and computers from a Windows domain through LDAP queries. By default, Windows Domain Controllers support basic LDAP operations through port 389/tcp. With any valid domain account (regardless of privileges), it is possible to perform LDAP queries against a domain controller for any AD related information. You can always use a tool like ldapsearch to perform custom LDAP queries against a Domain Controller. I found myself running different LDAP commands over and over again, and it was difficult to memorize all the custom LDAP queries. So this tool was born to help automate some of the most useful LDAP queries a pentester would want to perform in an AD environment.

				* Earlier this week, Microsoft issued patches for CVE-2019-1040, which is a vulnerability that allows for bypassing of NTLM relay mitigations. The vulnerability was discovered by Marina Simakov and Yaron Zinar (as well as several others credited in the Microsoft advisory), and they published a technical write-up about the vulnerability here. The short version is that this vulnerability allows for bypassing of the Message Integrity Code in NTLM authentication. The impact of this however, is quite big if combined with the Printer Bug discovered by Lee Christensen and some of my own research that builds forth on the Kerberos research of Elad Shamir. Using a combination of these vulnerabilities, it is possible to relay SMB authentication to LDAP. This allows for Remote code execution as SYSTEM on any unpatched Windows server or workstation (even those that are in different Active Directory forests), and for instant escalation to Domain Admin via any unpatched Exchange server (unless Exchange permissions were reduced in the domain). The most important takeaway of this post is that you should apply the June 2019 patches as soon as possible.

				* Orchestrating BloodHound and Empire for Automated AD Post-Exploitation. Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation are two of the main steps in the Active Directory attacker kill- chain. Applying the 'assume breach' mentality, more and more companies are asking for red-teaming type of assessments, and security researcher have therefor developed a wide range of open-source tools to assist them during these engagements. Out of these, two have quickly gained a solid reputation: PowerShell Empire and BloodHound (Both by @Harmj0y & ex-ATD Crew). In this Session, I will be presenting DogStrike, a new tool (PowerShell Modules) made to interface Empire & BloodHound, allowing penetration testers to merge their Empire infrastructure into the bloodhound graph database. Doing so allows the operator to request a bloodhound path that is 'Agent Aware', and makes it possible to automate the entire kill chain, from initial foothold to DA - or any desired part of an attacker's routine. Presentation will be demo-driven. Code for the module will be made public after the presentation. Automation of Active Directory post-exploitation is going to happen sooner than you might think. (Other tools are being released with the same goal). Is it a good thing? Is it a bad thing? If I do not run out of time, I would like to finish the presentation by opening the discussion with the audience and see what the consequences of automated post- exploitation could mean, from the red, the blue or any other point of view... : DeathStar by @Byt3Bl33d3r | GoFetch by @TalTheMaor.
		* **Tools**
			* [Check-LocalAdminHash](https://github.com/dafthack/Check-LocalAdminHash)
				* Check-LocalAdminHash is a PowerShell tool that attempts to authenticate to multiple hosts over either WMI or SMB using a password hash to determine if the provided credential is a local administrator. It's useful if you obtain a password hash for a user and want to see where they are local admin on a network.

			* [hunter](https://github.com/fdiskyou/hunter)
				* (l)user hunter using WinAPI calls only
			* [icebreaker](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/icebreaker)
				* Automates network attacks against Active Directory to deliver you piping hot plaintext credentials when you're inside the network but outside of the Active Directory environment. Performs 5 different network attacks for plaintext credentials as well as hashes. Autocracks hashes found with JohnTheRipper and the top 10 million most common passwords.
			* [Invoke-HostRecon](https://github.com/dafthack/HostRecon)
				* This function runs a number of checks on a system to help provide situational awareness to a penetration tester during the reconnaissance phase. It gathers information about the local system, users, and domain information. It does not use any 'net', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'netstat', or other system commands to help avoid detection.
			* [DeathStar](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/DeathStar)
				* DeathStar is a Python script that uses Empire's RESTful API to automate gaining Domain Admin rights in Active Directory  environments using a variety of techinques.
			* [ANGRYPUPPY](https://github.com/vysec/ANGRYPUPPY)
				* Bloodhound Attack Path Execution for Cobalt Strike
			* [GoFetch](https://github.com/GoFetchAD/GoFetch)
				* GoFetch is a tool to automatically exercise an attack plan generated by the BloodHound application.  GoFetch first loads a path of local admin users and computers generated by BloodHound and converts it to its own attack plan format. Once the attack plan is ready, GoFetch advances towards the destination according to plan step by step, by successively applying remote code execution techniques and compromising credentials with Mimikatz.

				* If you have compromised a Windows host, and cannot or do not want to, dump clear-text passwords using traditional techniques (e.g. mimikatz’s sekurlsa::logonpasswords, or LSASS dumping), you should check out the credential delegations settings. If enabled, it allows to obtain clear-text passwords without touching the LSASS process or even without having administrator rights (limited to the current user’s password then)!

			* [Credential Assessment: Mapping Privilege Escalation at Scale - Matt Weeks(Hack.lu 2016)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXx6RB0raEY)
				* In countless intrusions from large retail giants to oil companies, attackers have progressed from initial access to complete network compromise. In the aftermath, much ink is spilt and products are sold on how the attackers first obtained access and how the malware they used could or could not have been detected, while little attention is given to the credentials they found that turned their access on a single-system into thousands more. This process, while critical for offensive operations, is often complex, involving many links in the escalation chain composed of obtaining credentials on system A that grant access to system B and credentials later used on system B that grant further access, etc. We’ll show how to identify and combat such credential exposure at scale with the framework we developed. We comprehensively identify exposed credentials and automatically construct the compromise chains to identify maximal access and privileges gained, useful for either offensive or defensive purposes.

				* For years, you’ve tried to fight mimikatz, first to understand it, and maybe fight it again. This little kiwi fruit shaped program has given you a hard time, extracted your password, stolen your credentials, played with your nerves and certificates... But our friends in New Zealand know it best: there are many different kiwis... and perhaps the fruit is the most lucrative, but it's not the most sadistic. The kiwi animal may not fly, and it remains complex to build it from source, its effects are not less devastating...I will introduce "kekeo", the little animal brother of mimikatz. If you enjoyed playing with Kerberos, ASN1, security providers..., then you'll love adopting this furry, sweet animal. From its birth with MS14-068 to cleartext passwords without local administrator rights, you'll know everything about this animal. This talk will embed CredSSP and TSSP with cleartext credential, explore a little bit about PKINITMustiness and the RSA-on-the-fly for Kerberos with PKI!
		* **Tools**
			* [DomainPasswordTest](https://github.com/rvazarkar/DomainPasswordTest)
				* Tests AD passwords while respecting Bad Password Count
			* [serviceFu](https://github.com/securifera/serviceFu)
				* Automates credential skimming from service accounts in Windows Registry using Mimikatz lsadump::secrets. The use case for this tool is when you have administrative rights across certain computers in a domain but do not have any clear-text credentials. ServiceFu will remotely connect to target computers, check if any credentialed services are present, download the system and security registry hive, and decrypt clear-text credentials for the domain service account.

					* DIT Snapshot Viewer is an inspection tool for Active Directory database, ntds.dit. This tool connects to ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) and reads tables/records including hidden objects by low level C API. The tool can extract ntds.dit file without stopping lsass.exe. When Active Directory Service is running, lsass.exe locks the file and does not allow to access to it. The snapshot wizard copies ntds.dit using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) even if the file is exclusively locked. As copying ntds.dit may cause data inconsistency in ESE DB, the wizard automatically runs esentutil /repair command to fix the inconsistency.

				* Back in March 2018, I embarked on an arguably pointless crusade to prove that the TrustedToAuthForDelegation attribute was meaningless, and that “protocol transition” can be achieved without it. I believed that security wise, once constrained delegation was enabled (msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo was not null), it did not matter whether it was configured to use “Kerberos only” or “any authentication protocol”.  I started the journey with Benjamin Delpy’s (@gentilkiwi) help modifying Kekeo to support a certain attack that involved invoking S4U2Proxy with a silver ticket without a PAC, and we had partial success, but the final TGS turned out to be unusable. Ever since then, I kept coming back to it, trying to solve the problem with different approaches but did not have much success. Until I finally accepted defeat, and ironically then the solution came up, along with several other interesting abuse cases and new attack techniques.

The content in this post is based on Elad Shamir’s Kerberos research and combined with my own NTLM research to present an attack that can get code execution as SYSTEM on any Windows computer in Active Directory without any credentials, if you are in the same network segment. This is another example of insecure Active Directory default abuse, and not any kind of new exploit.

			    * Your crown jewels are locked in a database, the system is patched, utilizes modern endpoint security software, and permissions are carefully controlled and locked down. Once this system is joined to Active Directory, however, does that static trust model remain the same? Or has the number of attack paths to your data increased by an order of magnitude? We’ve spent the last year exploring the access control model of Active Directory and recently broadened our focus to include security descriptor misconfigurations/backdoor opportunities at the host level. We soon realized that the post-exploitation “attack surface” of Windows hosts spans well beyond what we originally realized, and that host misconfigurations can sometimes have a profound effect on the security of every other host in the forest. This talk will explore a number of lesser-known Active Directory and host-based permission settings that can be abused in concert for remote access, privilege escalation, or persistence. We will show how targeted host modifications (or existing misconfigurations) can facilitate complex Active Directory attack chains with far-reaching effects on other systems and services in the forest, and can allow new AD attack paths to be built without modifying Active Directory itself.

Below we'll walk through the steps of obtaining NetNTLMv1 Challenge/Response authentication, cracking those to NTLM Hashes, and using that NTLM Hash to sign a Kerberos Silver ticket. This will work on networks where "LAN Manager authentication level" is set to 2 or less. This is a fairly common scenario in older, larger Windows deployments. It should not work on Windows 10 / Server 2016 or newer.

However, this will not cause a failed logon to appear in the Windows® event log. It will also not increment the count of failed logon attempts for the service account. Therefore, the result is an ability to perform brute-force (or, more realistically, dictionary-based) password checks for such a service account, without locking it out or generating suspicious event log entries.

				* Kerberos, besides having three heads and guarding the gates of hell, protects services on Microsoft Windows Domains. Its use is increasing due to the growing number of attacks targeting NTLM authentication. Attacking Kerberos to access Windows resources represents the next generation of attacks on Windows authentication.In this talk Tim will discuss his research on new attacks against Kerberos- including a way to attack the credentials of a remote service without sending traffic to the service as well as rewriting tickets to access systems.He will also examine potential countermeasures against Kerberos attacks with suggestions for mitigating the most common weaknesses in Windows Kerberos deployments.

				* Nowadays, most of the environments are using Active Directory to manage their networks and resources. And over the past years, the attackers have been focused to abuse and attack the Active Directory environments using different techniques and methodologies. So in this research paper, we are going to use the power of the PowerShell to enumerate the resources of the Active Directory, like enumerating the domains, users, groups, ACL, GPOs, domain trusts also hunting the users and the domain admins. With this valuable information, we can increase our attack surface to abuse the AD like Privilege escalation, lateral movements and persistence and so on.

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.

				* Check-LocalAdminHash is a new PowerShell script that can check a password hash against multiple hosts to determine if it’s a valid administrative credential. It also has the ability to exfiltrate all PowerShell PSReadline console history files from every profile on every system that the credential provided is an administrator of.
			* [Check-LocalAdminHash](https://github.com/dafthack/Check-LocalAdminHash)
				* Check-LocalAdminHash is a PowerShell tool that attempts to authenticate to multiple hosts over either WMI or SMB using a password hash to determine if the provided credential is a local administrator. It's useful if you obtain a password hash for a user and want to see where they are local admin on a network. It is essentially a Frankenstein of two of my favorite tools along with some of my own code. It utilizes Kevin Robertson's (@kevin_robertson) Invoke-TheHash project for the credential checking portion. Additionally, the script utilizes modules from PowerView by Will Schroeder (@harmj0y) and Matt Graeber (@mattifestation) to enumerate domain computers to find targets for testing admin access against.
			* [Wireless_Query](https://github.com/gobiasinfosec/Wireless_Query)
				* Query Active Directory for Workstations and then Pull their Wireless Network Passwords. This tool is designed to pull a list of machines from AD and then use psexec to pull their wireless network passwords. This should be run with either a DOMAIN or WORKSTATION Admin account.

			* [ACLight](https://github.com/cyberark/ACLight)
				* The tool queries the Active Directory (AD) for its objects' ACLs and then filters and analyzes the sensitive permissions of each one. The result is a list of domain privileged accounts in the network (from the advanced ACLs perspective of the AD). You can run the scan with just any regular user (could be non-privileged user) and it automatically scans all the domains of the scanned network forest.
			* [zBang](https://github.com/cyberark/zBang)
				* zBang is a special risk assessment tool that detects potential privileged account threats in the scanned network.

	* [Conveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Conveigh)
		* Conveigh is a Windows PowerShell LLMNR/NBNS spoofer detection tool. LLMNR/NBNS requests sent by Conveigh are not legitimate requests to any enabled LLMNR/NBNS services. The requests will not result in name resolution in the event that a spoofer is present.
	* [Respounder](https://github.com/codeexpress/respounder)
		* Respounder sends LLMNR name resolution requests for made-up hostnames that do not exist. In a normal non-adversarial network we do not expect such names to resolve. However, a responder, if present in the network, will resolve such queries and therefore will be forced to reveal itself.
	* [asker](https://github.com/eavalenzuela/asker)
		* This tool takes a list of known-bogus local hostnames, and sends out LLMNR requests for them every 5-25 legitimate LLMNR requests from other hosts. This is intended for use by a blue team who wants to catch a red team or attacker using Responder, who either does not target-select carefully enough, or falls for the bogus hostnames which should be tailored to the environment (e.g. if there is a DC named "addc1", you might want to add "adddc1" to the list.

		* [How Microsoft IT used Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 to implement privileged access workstations](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/54896)
			* As part of the security strategy to protect administrative privilege, Microsoft recommends using a dedicated machine, referred to as PAW (privileged access workstation), for administrative tasks; and using a separate device for the usual productivity tasks such as Outlook and Internet browsing. This can be costly for the company to acquire machines just for server administrative tasks, and inconvenient for the admins to carry multiple machines. In this session, we show you how MSIT uses shielded VMs on the new release of Windows client to implement a PAW.

			* There is no doubt that security has been in the spotlight over the last few years, recent events have been responsible for the increased demand for better and more secure systems. Security was often treated as an afterthought or something that could be implemented ‘later’. In this session, we will go over some best practices, using existing tools and frameworks to help you set up a more secure environment and to get a grasp of what is happening in your environment. We will leverage your existing automation skills to secure and automate these workflows. Expect a session with a lot of demos and resources that can directly be implemented.

			* Over the past few years, Palantir has a maintained an internal Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) pipeline for generating and centrally collecting logs of forensic and security value from Microsoft Windows hosts. Once these events are collected and indexed, alerting and detection strategies (ADS) can be constructed not only on high-fidelity security events (e.g. log deletion), but also for deviations from normalcy, such as unusual service account access, access to sensitive filesystem or registry locations, or installation of malware persistence. The goal of this project is to provide the necessary building blocks for organizations to rapidly evaluate and deploy WEF to a production environment, and centralize public efforts to improve WEF subscriptions and encourage adoption. While WEF has become more popular in recent years, it is still dramatically underrepresented in the community, and it is our hope that this project may encourage others to adopt it for incident detection and response purposes. We acknowledge the efforts that Microsoft, IAD, and other contributors have made to this space and wish to thank them for providing many of the subscriptions, ideas, and techniques that will be covered in this post.

		* ClrGuard is a proof of concept project to explore instrumenting the Common Language Runtime (CLR) for security purposes. ClrGuard leverages a simple appInit DLL (ClrHook32/64.dll) in order to load into all CLR/.NET processes. From there, it performs an in-line hook of security critical functions. Currently, the only implemented hook is on the native LoadImage() function. When events are observed, they are sent over a named pipe to a monitoring process for further introspection and mitigation decision.
