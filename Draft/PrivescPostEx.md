		* [Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~safari/pubs/kim-isca14.pdf)
			* Abstract. Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure computing system — an access to one memory ad- dress should not have unintended side e ects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more diffcult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row’s wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling e ects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing plat- form. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining var- ious potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors.

			* Today’s post is about Browser Pivoting with Chrome. For anyone unaware of Browser Pivoting, it’s a technique which essentially leverages an exploited system to gain access to the browser’s authenticated sessions. This is not a new technique, in fact, Raphael Mudge wrote about it in 2013. Detailed in the linked post, the Browser Pivot module for Cobalt Strike targets IE only, and as far as I know, cannot be used against Chrome. In this post we’re trying to achieve a similar result while taking a different approach – stealing the target’s Chrome profile in real time. Just a FYI, if you have the option to use Cobalt Strike’s Browser Pivot module instead, do so, it’s much cleaner.

If no username and password are provided, nullinux will attempt to connect to the target using an SMB null session. Unlike many of the enumeration tools out there already, nullinux can enumerate multiple targets at once and when finished, creates a users.txt file of all users found on the host(s). This file is formatted for direct implementation and further exploitation.This program assumes Python 2.7, and the smbclient package is installed on the machine. Run the setup.sh script to check if these packages are installed.

It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

			* [Kerberos Credential Thiever (GNU/Linux) - Ronan Loftus, Arne Zismer](https://www.delaat.net/rp/2016-2017/p97/report.pdf)
				* Kerberos is an authentication protocol that aims to reduce the amount of sensitive data that needs to be sent across a network with lots of network resources that require authentication.  This reduces the risk of having authentication data stolen by an attacker.  Network Attached Storage devices, big data processing applications like Hadoop, databases and web servers commonly run on GNU/Linux machines that are integrated in a Kerberos system.  Due to the sensitivity of the data these services deal with, their security is of great importance.  There has been done a lot of research about sniffing and replaying Kerberos  credentials  from  the  network.   However,  little  work  has  been  done  on  stealing  credentials from Kerberos clients on GNU/Linux.  We therefore investigate the feasibility of extracting and reusing Kerberos credentials from GNU/Linux machines.  In this research we show that all the credentials can be extracted, independently of how they are stored on the client.  We also show how these credentials can be reused to impersonate the compromised client.  In order to improve the security of Kerberos, we also propose mitigations to these attacks.

Armed with the bug, it was trivial to programmatically bypass Apple's touted 'User-Approved Kext' security feature, dump all passwords from the keychain, bypass 3rd-party security tools, and much more! And as Apple's patch was incomplete (surprise surprise) we'll drop an 0day that (still) allows unprivileged code to post synthetic events and bypass various security mechanisms on a fully patched macOS box!

			* Macs are becoming commonplace in corporate environments as a alternative to Windows systems. Developers, security teams, and executives alike favor the ease of use and full administrative control Macs provide. However, their systems are often joined to an active directory domain and ripe for attackers to leverage for initial access and lateral movement. Mac malware is evolving as Mac computers continue to grow in popularity. As a result, there is a need for proactive detection of attacks targeting MacOS systems in a enterprise environment. Despite advancements in MacOS security tooling for a single user/endpoint, little is known and discussed regarding detection at a enterprise level. This talk will discuss common tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers on MacOS systems, as well as methods to detect adversary activity. We will take a look at known malware, mapping the techniques utilized to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Attendees will leave equipped to begin hunting for evil lurking within their MacOS fleet.

			* In this research, we'll dive into the installer's Mach-O binary to demonstrate how it piggy-backs on 'non-lazy' Objective-C classes, the way it dynamically unpacks its code section in memory and decrypts its config. An in-depth analysis will reveal the structure of its engine and a full scope of its hidden backdoor capabilities, anti-debugging, VM evasion techniques and other interesting tricks that are so typical to the Windows malware scene but aren’t commonly found in the unwanted apps that claim to be clean, particularly on the Mac platform. This talk reveals practical hands-on tricks used in Mach-O binary analysis under a Hackintosh VM guest, using LLDB debugger and IDA Pro disassembler, along with a very interesting marker found during such analysis. Curious to learn what that marker was? Willing to see how far the Mac-specific techniques evolved in relation to Windows malware?

This agent is incorporated into a broader open source project designed for collaborative red teaming I created called Apfell. I will discuss TTPs for doing reconnaissance, persistence, injection, and some keylogging all without using a shell command or spawning another scripting language. I will go into details of how JXA can be used to create an agent complete with encrypted key exchange for secure communications, domain fronting C2, and modular design to load or change key functionality on the fly. I will also cover the defensive considerations of these TTPs and how Apple is starting to secure these capabilities going forward.

				* The Admin framework in Apple OS X contains a hidden backdoor API to root privileges. It’s been there for several years (at least since 2011), I found it in October 2014 and it can be exploited to escalate privileges to root from any user account in the system. The intention was probably to serve the “System Preferences” app and systemsetup (command-line tool), but any user process can use the same functionality. Apple has now released OS X 10.10.3 where the issue is resolved. OS X 10.9.x and older remain vulnerable, since Apple decided not to patch these versions. We recommend that all users upgrade to 10.10.3.

				* XPC or cross process communication is a way for OSX and iOS processes to communicate with one another and share information. One use for this is to elevate privileges using a daemon who listens as a XPC service. While Apple has released a coding guideline it is all to often ignored or incorrectly implemented in third-party applications. One striking example of this is the Privileged Helper Tool. In this talk I am going to dive into what a Privileged Helper Tool is and why you should care about it. I will show the viewers how to locate these on an OSX computer and walk through the reverse engineering steps needed to identify if the service is vulnerable. We will then set up communications via Objective-C to deliver a privilege escalation attack. I will be showcasing twenty plus vulnerabilities in at least five products. All tooling and code will be released with the talk!

	    		* [Slides](https://objectivebythesea.com/v2/talks/OBTS_v2_Fitzl.pdf)
			    * This talk is about my journey from trying to find dylib hijacking vulnerability in a particular application to finding a privilege escalation vulnerability in macOS. During the talk I will try to show the research process, how did I moved from one finding to the next and I will also show many of the failures / dead ends I had during the exploit development.First I will briefly cover what is a dylib hijacking, and what is the current state of various application regarding this type of vulnerability. We will see how hard is to exploit these in many cases due to the fact that root access is required. Second I will cover two seemingly harmless bugs affecting the installation process of AppStore apps, and we will see how can we chain these together in order to gain root privileges - for this we will utilise a completely benign app from the macOS App Store. Part of this I will cover how can we submit apps to the store, and what are the difficulties with that process.In the last part I will cover how we can infect and include our malicious file in an App installer without breaking the App’s signature.

				* Applications on macOS use a common and flawed method of loading dynamic libraries (dylib), which leaves them vulnerable to a post-exploitation technique known as dylib hijacking. Dylib hijacking is a technique used to exploit this flawed loading method in order to achieve privilege escalation, persistence, or the ability to run arbitrary code. This talk provides an overview of the attack vector and the process involved in exploiting vulnerable applications. Additionally, the process of automating the exploitation of vulnerable applications will be demonstrated and discussed in depth. The tools developed and used for this demonstration will be made publicly available.

			* [boko](https://github.com/bashexplode/boko)
				* boko.py is an application scanner for macOS that searches for and identifies potential dylib hijacking and weak dylib vulnerabilities for application executables, as well as scripts an application may use that have the potential to be backdoored. The tool also calls out interesting files and lists them instead of manually browsing the file system for analysis. With the active discovery function, there's no more guess work if an executable is vulnerable to dylib hijacking!

I won’t cover every single detail of the permission model, as it would be a topic in itself, but rather what I found interesting from the exploitation perspective. Then I will cover how to find these bugs, and finally I will go through in detail all of the bugs I found. Some of these are very interesting as we will see, as exploitation of them involves “writing” to files owned by root, while we are not root, which is not trivial, and can be very tricky.

			* This talk is centered around red teaming in MacOS environments. Traditionally, MacOS post exploitation has largely been done in python with a heavy reliance on command line utilities. However, as defender tradecraft continues to evolve with detecting suspicious python usage on MacOS, we (as red teamers) should consider migrating to different post exploitation methods. In this talk, I will share why the Swift language can be beneficial for red teaming macOS environments. I will also share some macOS post exploitation code I have written using the Swift programming language and contrast detection techniques between python and Swift based post exploitation.

    			* What do your iCloud, Slack, MS Office, etc. credentials have in common? Correct, they're all stored inside your Mac's Keychain. While the Keychain is great because it prevents all those annoying password prompts from disturbing you, the ultimate question is: Is it really safe? Does it prevent malicious Apps from stealing all my passwords?In this talk I will try to answer those questions, showing you how the Keychain works and how it can be exploited by showing you the full details of my KeySteal exploit for the first time. The complete exploit code will be available online after the talk.

		* APOLLO stands for Apple Pattern of Life Lazy Output’er. I wanted to create this tool to be able to easily correlate multiple databases with hundreds of thousands of records into a timeline that would make the analyst (me, mostly) be able to tell what has happened on the device. iOS (and MacOS) have these absolutely fantastic databases that I’ve been using for years with my own personal collection of SQL queries to do what I need to get done. This is also a way for me to share my own research and queries with the community. Many of these queries have taken hours, even days to research and compile into something useful. My goal with this script is to put the analysis function the SQL query itself. Each query will output a different part of the puzzle. The script itself just compiles the data into a CSV or SQLite database for viewing and filtering. While this database/spreadsheet can get very large, it is still more efficient that running queries on multiple databases and compiling the data into a timeline manually.

			* [Abusing Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) - Matthew Graeber(BH USA 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SjMgnGwpq8)
				* Imagine a technology that is built into every Windows operating system going back to Windows 95, runs as System, executes arbitrary code, persists across reboots, and does not drop a single file to disk. Such a thing does exist and it's called Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). With increased scrutiny from anti-virus and 'next-gen' host endpoints, advanced red teams and attackers already know that the introduction of binaries into a high-security environment is subject to increased scrutiny. WMI enables an attacker practicing a minimalist methodology to blend into their target environment without dropping a single utility to disk. WMI is also unlike other persistence techniques in that rather than executing a payload at a predetermined time, WMI conditionally executes code asynchronously in response to operating system events. This talk will introduce WMI and demonstrate its offensive uses. We will cover what WMI is, how attackers are currently using it in the wild, how to build a full-featured backdoor, and how to detect and prevent these attacks from occurring.

			* [Post-Exploitation on Windows using ActiveX Controls](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=3&t=sumry)
				* When exploiting software vulnerabilities it is sometimes impossible to build direct communication channels between a target machine and an attacker's machine due to restrictive outbound filters that may be in place on the target machine's network. Bypassing these filters involves creating a post-exploitation payload that is capable of masquerading as normal user traffic from within the context of a trusted process. One method of accomplishing this is to create a payload that enables ActiveX controls by modifying Internet Explorer's zone restrictions. With ActiveX controls enabled, the payload can then launch a hidden instance of Internet Explorer that is pointed at a URL with an embedded ActiveX control. The end result is the ability for an attacker to run custom code in the form of a DLL on a target machine by using a trusted process that uses one or more trusted communication protocols, such as HTTP or DNS.

This service is the client part of the HLK setup one may build in order to perform driver/hardware tests on the IoT device. It serves the Sirep/WPCon/TShell protocol. We broke down the Sirep/WPCon protocol and demonstrated how this protocol exposes a remote command interface for attackers, that include RAT abilities such as get/put arbitrary files on arbitrary locations and obtain system information. Based on the findings we have extracted from this research about the service and protocol, we built a simple python tool that allows exploiting them using the different supported commands. We called it SirepRAT. It features an easy and intuitive user interface for sending commands to a Windows IoT Core target. It works on any cable-connected device running Windows IoT Core with an official Microsoft image.

					* [Slides](https://github.com/r4wd3r/RID-Hijacking/blob/master/slides/derbycon-8.0/RID_HIJACKING_DERBYCON_2018.pdf)
					* The art of persistence is (and will be...) a matter of concern when successfully exploitation is achieved. Sometimes it is pretty tricky to maintain access on certain environments, especially when it is not possible to execute common vectors like creating or adding users to privileged groups, dumping credentials or hashes, deploying a persistent shell, or anything that could trigger an alert on the victim. This statement ratifies why it's necessary to use discrete and stealthy techniques to keep an open door right after obtaining a high privilege access on the target. What could be more convenient that only use OS resources in order to persist an access? This presentation will provide a new post-exploitation hook applicable to all Windows versions called RID Hijacking, which allows setting desired privileges to an existent account in a stealthy manner by modifying some security attributes. To show its effectiveness, the attack will be demonstrated by using a module which was recently added by Rapid7 to their Metasploit Framework, and developed by the security researcher Sebastián Castro.

			* [Alternate-Data-Streams with PowerShell](https://github.com/davehardy20/Alternate-Data-Streams)
				* I literally stumbled upon this whilst reading up on the parameters for the Get-Content and Set-Content cmdlets for another piece of research. The parameter that got my interest is -Stream which allows the user the ability to read and write NTFS alternate data streams. If we create a file with the following commands: `$file = "$env:TEMP\test.txt" \ Set-Content -Path $file -Value 'Alternate Data Stream Test File'`. To read the file content, we use the following: `Get-Content -Path $file` ; Which will return: `Alternate Data Stream Test File`
			* [Get-ADS](https://github.com/p0shkatz/Get-ADS)
				* Powershell script to search for alternate data streams This script searches recursively through a specified file system for alternate data streams (ADS). The script can search local and UNC paths speciffied by the $path paramenter. All readable files will have the stream attrubute inspected ignoring the default DATA and FAVICON (image file on URL files) streams. The script use Boe Prox's amazing Get-RunspaceData function and other code to multithread the search. The default number of threads is the number of logical cores plus one. This can be adjusted by specifiying the $threads parameter. Use with caution as runspaces can easily chomp resources (CPU and RAM). Once the number of file system objects (files and folders) is determined, they are split into equal groups of objects divided by the number of threads. Then each thread has a subset of the total objects to inspect for ADS.

The original implementation was a bit more complex, including broadcasting the changed password over the network etc. but now it works as a demonstration of an idea, so let's keep it as simple as possible. It works everywhere - on local machines for local accounts and on DCs for domain accounts.

			* Tools like metasploit are great for exploiting computers, but what happens after you've gained access to a computer? Backdoorme answers that question by unleashing a slew of backdoors to establish persistence over long periods of time. Once an SSH connection has been established with the target, Backdoorme's strengths can come to fruition. Unfortunately, Backdoorme is not a tool to gain root access - only keep that access once it has been gained.

			* Local privilege escalation on Windows is becoming increasingly difficult. Gone are the days when you could just easily exploit the Windows kernel. Multiple controls (KASLR, DEP, SMEP, etc.) have made kernel mode exploitation of the bugs that are discovered much more difficult. In this talk, we'll discuss multiple opportunities for privilege escalation including using COM objects, DLL side loading, and various privileges assigned to user accounts. Bring a Windows 10 VM. We'll have instructions available for recreating the scenarios demonstrated in the talk.

During this review, I figured out the Windows 10 Task Scheduler service was looking for a missing DLL exposing it to DLL hijacking/planting. It opens for persistence and privilege escalation in case one can write a rogue DLL in a folder pointed by the PATH environment variable. It can also be used as a UAC bypass.

					* This blog post discusses two vulnerabilities discovered by NCC Group consultants during research undertaken on privilege elevation via COM local services. The first of these vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-1405) is a logic error in a COM service and allows local unprivileged users to execute arbitrary commands as a LOCAL SERVICE user. The second vulnerability (CVE-2019-1322) is a simple service misconfiguration that allows any user in the local SERVICE group to reconfigure a service that executes as SYSTEM (this vulnerability was independently also discovered by other researchers). When combined, these vulnerabilities allow an unprivileged local user to execute arbitrary commands as the SYSTEM user on a default installation of Windows 10.

By chance I have found such a path using an unlikely quirk in the Windows Error Reporting Service.

					* Earlier this week, Microsoft issued patches for CVE-2019-1040, which is a vulnerability that allows for bypassing of NTLM relay mitigations. The vulnerability was discovered by Marina Simakov and Yaron Zinar (as well as several others credited in the Microsoft advisory), and they published a technical write-up about the vulnerability here. The short version is that this vulnerability allows for bypassing of the Message Integrity Code in NTLM authentication. The impact of this however, is quite big if combined with the Printer Bug discovered by Lee Christensen and some of my own research that builds forth on the Kerberos research of Elad Shamir. Using a combination of these vulnerabilities, it is possible to relay SMB authentication to LDAP. This allows for Remote code execution as SYSTEM on any unpatched Windows server or workstation (even those that are in different Active Directory forests), and for instant escalation to Domain Admin via any unpatched Exchange server (unless Exchange permissions were reduced in the domain). The most important takeaway of this post is that you should apply the June 2019 patches as soon as possible.
					* [CVE-2019-1040 scanner](https://github.com/fox-it/cve-2019-1040-scanner)
						* Checks for CVE-2019-1040 vulnerability over SMB. The script will establish a connection to the target host(s) and send an invalid NTLM authentication. If this is accepted, the host is vulnerable to CVE-2019-1040 and you can execute the MIC Remove attack with ntlmrelayx. Note that this does not generate failed login attempts as the login information itself is valid, it is just the NTLM message integrity code that is absent, which is why the authentication is refused without increasing the badpwdcount.

NTLM reflection is still possible through a highly reliable timing attack. The attack works by abusing the logic responsible for its mitigation, a widely speculated challenge cache. Attackers can purge this cache by deliberately failing an authentication attempt and doing so removes all challenge entries older than 5 minutes.

For example as Vincent Yiu pointed out on Twitter if you've got easy access to a system token, say using Metasploit's getsystem command you can impersonate system and then open the TI token, it's just IMO less easy :-). If you get a system token with SeTcbPrivilege you can also call LogonUserExExW or LsaLogonUser where you can specify an set of additional groups to apply to a service token. Finally if you get a system token with SeCreateTokenPrivilege (say from LSASS.exe if it's not running PPL) you can craft an arbitrary token using the NtCreateToken system call.

					* One successful technique in social engineering is pretending to be someone or something you're not and hoping the security guard who's forgotten their reading glasses doesn't look too closely at your fake ID. Of course there's no hyperopic guard in the Windows OS, but we do have an ID card, the Access Token which proves our identity to the system and let's us access secured resources. The Windows kernel provides simple capabilities to identify fake Access Tokens, but sometimes the kernel or other kernel-mode drivers are too busy to use them correctly. If a fake token isn't spotted during a privileged operation local elevation of privilege or information disclosure vulnerabilities can be the result. This could allow an attacker to break out of an application sandbox, elevate to administrator privileges, or even compromise the kernel itself. This presentation is about finding and then exploiting the incorrect handling of tokens in the Windows kernel as well as first and third party drivers. Examples of serious vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2015-0002 and CVE-2015-0062 will be presented. It will provide clear exploitable patterns so that you can do your own security reviews for these issues. Finally, I'll discuss some of the ways of exploiting these types of vulnerabilities to elevate local privileges.

				* In Windows 10, Microsoft introduced the AntiMalware Scan Interface (AMSI) which is designed to target script-based attacks and malware. Script-based attacks have been lethal for enterprise security and with advent of PowerShell, such attacks have become increasingly common. AMSI targets malicious scripts written in PowerShell, VBScript, JScript etc. and drastically improves detection and blocking rate of malicious scripts. When a piece of code is submitted for execution to the scripting host, AMSI steps in and the code is scanned for malicious content. What makes AMSI effective is, no matter how obfuscated the code is, it needs to be presented to the script host in clear text and unobfuscated. Moreover, since the code is submitted to AMSI just before execution, it doesn't matter if the code came from disk, memory or was entered interactively. AMSI is an open interface and MS says any application will be able to call its APIs. Currently, Windows Defender uses it on Windows 10. Has Microsoft finally killed script-based attacks? What are the ways out? The talk will be full of live demonstrations.

				* A deep dive into file formats used in MS Office and how we can leverage these for offensive purposes. We will show how to fully weaponize ‘p-code’ across all MS Office versions in order to create malicious documents without using VBA code, successfully bypassing antivirus and other defensive measures. In this talk Stan and Pieter will do a deep dive into the file formats used in MS Office, demonstrating many features that can be used offensively. They will present attacks that apply to both the legacy formats (OLE streams) and the newer XML based documents. Specific focus is around the internal representation of VBA macros and pseudo code (p-code, execodes) and how these can be weaponized. We will detail the inner logic of Word and Excel regarding VBA and p-code, and release scripts and tools for creating malicious Office documents that bypass anti-virus, YARA rules, AMSI for VBA and various MS Office document analyzers.

The security market is focusing on open source data collection sources and security researchers as the main method to write signatures to detect attacks, much like what we saw in the 90s with traditional anti-virus tech. Not much has changed, let’s dive into the reality in security and how little these protective measures really do in the grand scheme of things. We’ll also be covering solid practices in defending against attacks, and what we should be focusing on.

				* “The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.” George Orwell. Objective truth is essential for security. Logs, notifications and saved data must reflect the actual events for security tools, forensic teams and IT managers to perform their job correctly. Powershell is a prime example of the constant cat and mouse game hackers and security personnel play every day to either reveal or hide the “objective truth” of a running script. Powershell’s auto logging, obfuscation techniques, AMSI and more are all participants of the same game playing by the same rules. We don’t like rules, so we broke them. As a result, Babel-Shellfish and Invisi-Shelltwo new tools that both expose and disguise powershell scripts were born. Babel-Shellfish reveals the inner hidden code of any obfuscated script while Invisi-Shell offers a new method of hiding malicious scripts, even from the Powershell process running it. Join us as we present a new way to think about scripts.

				* How to bypass all Microsoft latest "Attack Surface Reduction" rules with malicious Office documents and scripts. The last years, I have been doing some research around Windows security. I liked exploring APT/Redteam techniques and payload used for social engineering and airgap bypass attacks. I am naturally interested into new security features such as ASR. Microsoft introduced Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) as part of Windows defender exploit guard. ASR is composed of a set of configurable rules such as: "Block Office applications from creating child process". While these rules seem effective against common Office and scripts malwares, there are ways to bypass all of them. We will go over each rule related to malicious Office or VB scripts behavior, analyze how It work behind the scene and find a way to bypass it. As example we will take common attack scenario and see how they can be achieved with all rules enforced: Download execute DLL/EXE/script from Office/VBscript; Drop execute embedded DLL/EXE/script from Office/VBscript; Machine takeover with Meterpreter shell from Office/VBscript; Lateral movement/UAC bypass/AMSI bypass/etc.

			* [Testing UAC on Windows 10 - Ernesto Fernandez](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319454675_Testing_UAC_on_Windows_10)
				* User Account Control (UAC) is a mechanism implemented in Windows systems from Vista to prevent malicious software from executing with administrative privileges without user consent. However, this mechanism does not provide a secure solution to that problem, since can be easily bypassed in some ways, something we will show by means of different methods such as DLL hijacking, token impersonation or COM interface elevation, also we will show a new method which we have developed based on a previous one. Moreover, this new Proof of Concept has been ported to the Metasploit Framework as a new module, which indeed is the only UAC bypass module that works in the latest Windows 10 build version.

				* This exploit abuses the way "WinSxS" is managed by "dccw.exe" by means of a derivative Leo's Davidson "Bypass UAC" method so as to obtain an administrator shell without prompting for consent. It supports "x86" and "x64" architectures. Moreover, it has been successfully tested on Windows 8.1 9600, Windows 10 14393, Windows 10 15031 and Windows 10 15062.
			* [Bypass-UAC](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC)
				* Bypass-UAC provides a framework to perform UAC bypasses based on auto elevating IFileOperation COM object method calls. This is not a new technique, traditionally, this is accomplished by injecting a DLL into "explorer.exe". This is not desirable because injecting into explorer may trigger security alerts and working with unmanaged DLL's makes for an inflexible work-flow. To get around this, Bypass-UAC implements a function which rewrites PowerShell's PEB to give it the appearance of "explorer.exe". This provides the same effect because COM objects exclusively rely on Windows's Process Status API (PSAPI) which reads the process PEB.

				* Password managers allow the storage and retrieval of sensitive information from an encrypted database. Users rely on them to provide better security guarantees against trivial exfiltration than alternative ways of storing passwords, such as an unsecured flat text file. In this paper we propose security guarantees password managers should offer and examine the underlying workings of five popular password managers targeting the Windows 10 platform: 1Password 7, 1Password 4, Dashlane, KeePass, and LastPass. We anticipated that password managers would employ basic security best practices, such as scrubbing secrets from memory when they are not in use and sanitization of memory once a password manager was logged out and placed into a locked state. However, we found that in all password managers we examined, trivial secrets extraction was possible from a locked password manager, including the master password in some cases, exposing up to 60 million users that use the password managers in this study to secrets retrieval from an assumed secure locked state.

			* In this article, we have demonstrated that in some scenarios, the default Windows configuration leads to the SHA‑1 hash of the user’s password being stored to the disk in a way that is retrievable without any further knowledge about the password. We argue that this is an issue for DPAPI, because if the secret necessary for decrypting the master key was to be stored on the disk by design, Microsoft could have kept on using the NTLM hash it uses in domain settings (and supposedly used in the first implementation of DPAPI). We then demonstrated how this attack can be executed using readily available tools.

This tool connects to ESE (Extensible Storage Engine) and reads tables/records including hidden objects by low level C API. The tool can extract ntds.dit file without stopping lsass.exe. When Active Directory Service is running, lsass.exe locks the file and does not allow to access to it. The snapshot wizard copies ntds.dit using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) even if the file is exclusively locked. As copying ntds.dit may cause data inconsistency in ESE DB, the wizard automatically runs esentutil /repair command to fix the inconsistency.

				* Keyloggers are a prominent class of malware that harvests sensitive data by recording any typed in information. Key- logger implementations strive to hide their presence using rootkit-like techniques to evade detection by antivirus and other system protections. In this paper, we present a new approach for implementing a stealthy keylogger: we explore the possibility of leveraging the graphics card as an alterna- tive environment for hosting the operation of a keylogger. The key idea behind our approach is to monitor the system’s keyboard buffer directly from the GPU via DMA, without any hooks or modifications in the kernel’s code and data structures besides the page table. The evaluation of our pro- totype implementation shows that a GPU-based keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them in the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data in-place, with negligible runtime overhead.

				* If everything about that ticket-generation operation is valid except for the NTLM hash, then accessing the web application will result in a failure. However, this will not cause a failed logon to appear in the Windows® event log. It will also not increment the count of failed logon attempts for the service account. Therefore, the result is an ability to perform brute-force (or, more realistically, dictionary-based) password checks for such a service account, without locking it out or generating suspicious event log entries.

			* Last month Bleeping Computer published an article about PKTMON.EXE, a little known utility in Windows 10 that provides the ability to sniff and monitor network traffic.  I quickly wondered if it would be feasible to use this utility, and other native tools within Windows, to capture NTLMv2 network authentication handshakes. TL;DR: Yes it is possible and I wrote a Python3 script called NTLMRawUnHide that can extract NTLMv2 password hashes from packet dumps of many formats!
		* [NTLMRawUnhide.py](https://github.com/mlgualtieri/NTLMRawUnHide)
			* NTLMRawUnhide.py is a Python3 script designed to parse network packet capture files and extract NTLMv2 hashes in a crackable format. The tool was developed to extract NTLMv2 hashes from files generated by native Windows binaries like NETSH.EXE and PKTMON.EXE without conversion.

First, it was written in 32-bit Delphi (pardon my language) and when it stopped working as everything changed into 64-bit - in (so much simpler when it comes to Win32 API) C, as I did not have 64-bit Delphi. The original implementation was a bit more complex, including broadcasting the changed password over the network etc. but now it works as a demonstration of an idea, so let's keep it as simple as possible. It works everywhere - on local machines for local accounts and on DCs for domain accounts."

This saves you from trying your hashes against other accounts live, which triggers lockouts and alerts.

			* [Sharphose](https://github.com/ustayready/SharpHose)
				* SharpHose is a C# password spraying tool designed to be fast, safe, and usable over Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly. It provides a flexible way to interact with Active Directory using domain-joined and non-joined contexts, while also being able to target specific domains and domain controllers. SharpHose takes into consideration the domain password policy, including fine grained password policies, in an attempt to avoid account lockouts. Fine grained password policies are enumerated for the users and groups that that the policy applies to. If the policy applied also to groups, the group users are captured. All enabled domain users are then classified according to their password policies, in order of precedence, and marked as safe or unsafe. The remaining users are filtered against an optional user-supplied exclude list. Besides just spraying, red team operators can view all of the password policies for a domain, all the users affected by the policy, or just view the enabled domain users. Output can be sent directly to the console or to a user-supplied output folder.

				* Attackers have used the Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack for over two decades. Its effectiveness has led to several changes to the design of Windows. Those changes influenced the feasibility of the attack and the effectiveness of the tools used to execute it. At the same time, novel PtH attack strategies appeared. All this has led to confusion about what is still feasible and what configurations of Windows are vulnerable. This paper examines various methods of hash extraction and execution of the PtH attack. It identifies the prerequisites for the attack and suggests hardening options. Testing in Windows 10 v1903 supports the findings. Ultimately, this paper shows the level of risk posed by PtH to environments using the latest version of Windows 10.

The problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket- Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately- we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

		* [Abusing Common Cluster Configuration for Lateral Movement](https://www.lares.com/abusing-common-cluster-configuration-privileged-lateral-movement/)
			* Tech sites have published articles that walk a Windows Systems Administrator through the process of adding a machine account to the Local Administrators group on another machine. These accounts end in a $ (dollar sign) and look like SERVER$ in Active Directory. While this may be useful for simplifying the installation of clusters such as Lync, Exchange, or SQL Server, it’s not always the best idea. Servers that are set up in this way weaken the overall security posture of the cluster, and ultimately the organization, by allowing a single vulnerability or misconfiguration on one server the ability to move laterally without having to escalate privileges or compromise additional credentials. Using SQL Server as the example, any user who has READ permissions to a database essentially has SYSTEM-level permissions on a remote server. We’ll walk through that path below.

It investigates the extent to which this can be achieved without the benefit of a GUI and shows how this can be modified to generate valid EV certificates which are trusted by Windows. It is intended for penetration testers who are looking to install an implant binary which looks as legitimate as possible. None of these techniques are new, but it is hoped that this tool and project will make them easier and more accessible.

			* One of the more interesting classes of security vulnerabilities are those affecting interoperability technology. This is because these vulnerabilities typically affect any application using the technology, regardless of what the application actually does. Also in many cases they’re difficult for a developer to mitigate outside of not using that technology, something which isn’t always possible. I discovered one such vulnerability class in the Component Object Model (COM) interoperability layers of .NET which make the use of .NET for Distributed COM (DCOM) across privilege boundaries inherently insecure. This blog post will describe a couple of ways this could be abused, first to gain elevated privileges and then as a remote code execution vulnerability.

			* All popular browsers allow users to store sensitive data such as credentials for online and cloud services (such as social networks, email providers, and banking) and forms data (e.g. Credit card number, address, phone number) In Windows environment, most browsers (and many other applications) choose to protect these secrets by using Window Data Protection API (DPAPI), which provides an easy method to encrypt and decrypt secret data. Lately, Mimikatz, a popular pentest/hacking tool, was updated to include a functionality that allows highly-privileged attackers to decrypt all of DPAPI secrets. In this talk, I will analyze the Mimikatz Anti-DPAPI attack targeting the Domain Controller (DC) which puts all DPAPI secrets in peril and show how it can be defeated with network monitoring.

			* Windows credentials manager stores users’ credentials in special folders called vaults. Being able to access such credentials could be truly useful during a digital investigation for example, to gain access to other protected systems. Moreover, if data is in the cloud, there is the need to have the proper tokens to access it. This presentation will describe vaults’ internals and how they can be decrypted; the related Python Open Source code will be made publicly available. During the session, credentials and vaults coming from Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 will be decrypted, focusing on particular cases of interest. Finally, the presentation will address the challenges coming from Windows Phone, such as getting system-users’ passwords and obtaining users’ ActiveSync tokens.

		* [The LaZagne Project](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagneForensic)
			* LaZagne uses an internal Windows function called CryptUnprotectData to decrypt user passwords. This API should be called on the victim user session, otherwise, it does not work. If the computer has not been started (when the analysis is realized on an offline mounted disk), or if we do not want to drop a binary on the remote host, no passwords can be retrieved. LaZagneForensic has been created to avoid this problem. This work has been mainly inspired by the awesome work done by Jean-Michel Picod and Elie Bursztein for DPAPICK and Francesco Picasso for Windows DPAPI laboratory.

A manifest is an XML file that contains the elements that identify your provider. The convention is to use .man as the extension for your manifest. The manifest must conform to the event manifest XSD.

			* You’ll learn how to diagnose incredibly complex issues in production systems such as excessive garbage collection pauses, slow startup due to JIT and disk accesses, and even sluggishness during the Windows boot process. We will also explore some ways to automate ETW collection and analysis to build self-diagnosing applications that identify high CPU issues, resource leaks, and concurrency problems and produce alerts and reports. In the course of the talk we will use innovative performance tools that haven’t been applied to ETW before — flame graphs for visualising call stacks and a command-line interface for dynamic, scriptable ETW tracing. ETW is truly a window into everything happening on your system, and it doesn’t require expensive licenses, invasive tools, or modifying your code in any way. It is a critical, first-stop skill on your way to mastering application performance and diagnostics.

While both projects have obvious defensive (and offensive) applications they should primarily be considered as research tools. For easy consumption, output data is serialized to JSON. The JSON data can either be written to file and analyzed locally using PowerShell, stored in the Windows eventlog or shipped off to 3rd party infrastructure such as Elasticsearch.

	* [The Remote Malicious Butler Did It! - Tal Be'ery, Chaim Hoch(BHUSA 2015)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xujWesUS1ZQ)
		* An Evil Maid attack is a security exploit that targets a computing device that has been left unattended. An evil maid attack is characterized by the attacker's ability to physically access the target multiple times without the owner's knowledge. On BlackHat Europe 2015, Ian Haken in his talk "Bypassing Local Windows Authentication to Defeat Full Disk Encryption" had demonstrated a smart Evil Maid attack which allows the attacker to bypass Bitlocker disk encryption in an enterprise's domain environment. The attacker can do so by connecting the unattended computer into a rogue Domain Controller and abusing a client side authentication vulnerability. As a result, Microsoft had released a patch to fix this vulnerability and mitigate the attack. While being a clever attack, the physical access requirement for the attack seems to be prohibitive and would prevent it from being used on most APT campaigns. As a result, defenders might not correctly prioritize the importance of patching it. In our talk, we reveal the "Remote Malicious Butler" attack, which shows how attackers can perform such an attack, remotely, to take a complete control over the remote computer. We will dive into the technical details of the attack including the rogue Domain Controller, the client-side vulnerability and the Kerberos authentication protocol network traffic that ties them. We would explore some other attack avenues, all leveraging on the rogue Domain Controller concept. We would conclude with the analysis of some practical generic detection and prevention methods against rogue Domain Controllers.

			* SharpNado is proof of concept tool that demonstrates how one could use .Net Remoting or Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to host smarter and dynamic .NET payloads.  SharpNado is not meant to be a full functioning, robust, payload delivery system nor is it anything groundbreaking. It's merely something to get the creative juices flowing on how one could use these technologies or others to create dynamic and hopefully smarter payloads. I have provided a few simple examples of how this could be used to either dynamically execute base64 assemblies in memory or dynamically compile source code and execute it in memory.  This, however, could be expanded upon to include different kinds of stagers, payloads, protocols, etc.

		* [Staying # & Bringing Covert Injection Tradecraft to .NET - The Wover, Ruben Boonen(BlueHat IL 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuxpMXTgV9s&feature=share)
			* As .NET has taken over as the preferred platform for development on Windows, many attackers have chosen to take advantage of its features for post-exploitation tradecraft. Legitimate APIs can be leveraged for nearly every imaginable task, managed code can be loaded and executed from memory with extraordinary ease, and scalable monitoring for suspicious usage of .NET APIs is a problem yet to be solved. However, offensive .NET tools are still hindered by a fundamental weakness: the inability to leverage unmanaged code (such as the Win32/NT APIs) safe from observation by EDR. Managed code must eventually invoke unmanaged code in order to interface with the operating system. It is here that the attacker may be caught in the hooks of any system keen on watching for fundamentally malicious behavior. To expose the depth of tradecraft still unexplored in .NET and highlight the fragility of many existing detections, we will detail the tools we have built for evading these hooks. All of our efforts have been integrated into SharpSploit, a .NET post-exploitation library written in C# that aims to highlight the attack surface of .NET and make the use of offensive .NET easier for red teamers. Over the past few months we have added numerous new tools and techniques for loading and executing unmanaged code safely from .NET. Unmanaged APIs may be safely accessed and modules loaded either from memory or from disk in the new DInvoke API, a dynamic replacement for .NET's PInvoke API. It also includes manual mapping, a generic syscall wrapper, a new technique we call Module Overloading, and more. Additionally, we have added a modular process injection API that allows tool developers to build their own injection technique. Simply select an allocation and injection primitive, pass in any options, and execute the result with your preferred payload. This exposes all possible design decisions to the user, and allows for easy adaptation when existing tools fail. In our talk we will focus on explaining the fundamental tradecraft behind these new developments, the challenges and requirements associated with them, and how they can be adapted to suit your needs. Additionally, we will discuss how SharpSploit can be combined with other open-source projects to be integrated into a red team's tooling. As much as possible, we will also discuss how to counter and detect the techniques that we have developed. Finally, we will explain the community-focused development of these projects and how you too can contribute to advance open-source .NET tradecraft

Files are stored in byte[] code definitions and when encryption and compression is applied, files become as obscure as they can get.

        		* How sure are you that your PowerShell code is prepared to handle anything that a user might throw at it? What if the user was an attacker attempting to circumvent security controls by exploiting a vulnerability in your script? This may sound unrealistic but this is a legitimate concern of the PowerShell team when including PowerShell code in the operating system. In a high-security environment where strict AppLocker or Device Guard rules are deployed, PowerShell exposes a large attack surface that can be used to circumvent security controls. While constrained language mode goes a long way in preventing malicious PowerShell code from executing, attackers will seek out vulnerabilities in trusted signed code in order to circumvent security controls. This talk will cover numerous different ways in which attackers can influence the execution of your code in unanticipated ways. A thorough discussion of mitigations against such attacks will then follow.

				* "Quite often, you may have heard people mention, “Why should you bother learning PowerShell, isn’t it dead?” or “Why not just use C#?” Many individuals in the offensive security field have a common misconception that PowerShell is obsolete for red team operations. Meanwhile, it remains one of the primary attack vectors employed by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). APTs are known for implementing sophisticated hacking tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to gain access to a system for an extended period of time. Their actions typically focus on high-value targets, which leave potentially crippling consequences to both nation-states and corporations. It is crucial that Red Teams accurately emulate real-world threats and do not ignore viable attack options. For this talk, we will walk through how many threat actors adapt and employ PowerShell tools. Our discussion begins with examining how script block logging and AMSI are powerful anti-offensive PowerShell measures. However, the implementation of script block logging places a technical burden on organizations to conduct auditing on a substantial amount of data. While AMSI is trivial to bypass for any capable adversary. Finally, we will demonstrate APT-like PowerShell techniques that remain incredibly effective against the latest generation of network defenses.

Because of this it is possible to define a custom COM object in the registry and force PowerShell to load a Dll. On load it is possible to change the LanguageMode to FullLanguage and break out of the restricted shell. This repo is a variation on this technique where a DotNetToJScript scriptlet is used to directly stage a .Net assembly into the PowerShell process.

Remoting underpins other technologies, including Workflow, Desired State Configuration, certain types of background jobs, and much more. This guide isn't intended to be a complete document of what Remoting is and does, although it does provide a good introduction. Instead, this guide is designed to document all the little configuration details that don't appear to be documented elsewhere.

			* It used to be that most people were just starting to hear about PowerShell. Over the last 3 years, this has changed dramatically. We now see Offensive and Defensive PowerShell tools, exploits specifically leveraging PowerShell and WMI, and more organizations are starting to be intentional for detection and monitoring of PowerShell scripts and commands. With this visibility, it is becoming a game of cat and mouse to leverage and detect PowerShell. In this talk, I will highlight some secrets I use to ensure my PowerShell exploits are successful and some unique tactics which will bypass common defensive controls. I will also walk you through the creation of a custom PowerShell C# DLL which you can use to compromise your target. If you want to code with me, be sure to bring a laptop with Visual Studio 2013 or later installed.
		* [Goodbye Obfuscation, Hello Invisi Shell: Hiding Your Powershell Script in Plain Sight - Omer Yair(Derbycon2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3oMEiySxcc)
			* “The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. Lies will pass into history.” George Orwell. Objective truth is essential for security. Logs, notifications and saved data must reflect the actual events for security tools, forensic teams and IT managers to perform their job correctly. Powershell is a prime example of the constant cat and mouse game hackers and security personnel play every day to either reveal or hide the “objective truth” of a running script. Powershell’s auto logging, obfuscation techniques, AMSI and more are all participants of the same game playing by the same rules. We don’t like rules, so we broke them. As a result, Babel-Shellfish and Invisi-Shelltwo new tools that both expose and disguise powershell scripts were born. Babel-Shellfish reveals the inner hidden code of any obfuscated script while Invisi-Shell offers a new method of hiding malicious scripts, even from the Powershell process running it. Join us as we present a new way to think about scripts.

				* Defeating The Latest Advances in Script Obfuscation Mark Mager Mark Mager - @magerbomb In this age of increasingly sophisticated and devastating malware, adversaries still rely on a multitude of scripting languages and frameworks (e.g. JavaScript, VBA, PowerShell, VBScript) as key components of an attack scenario. These scripts tend to employ obfuscation techniques in order to obscure their true intent and avoid detection by endpoint protection products. Though significant advances have been made in recent years in packing and obfuscating compiled binaries, script obfuscation can still be defeated with time and a determined analyst. This talk will cover some of the most recently seen advanced obfuscation techniques employed by APTs, exploit kits, and other malware authors along with proven methods for circumventing and decoding these techniques. I will then apply these methods to guide the audience through the deobfuscation of a fully obfuscated script. Audience members will walk away with a solid understanding of how common obfuscation techniques are employed in scripting languages along with how they can be defeated.

			* [SharpChisel](https://github.com/shantanu561993/SharpChisel)
				* C# Wrapper of Chisel from https://github.com/jpillora/chisel
			* [Crowbar](https://github.com/q3k/crowbar)
				* Crowbar is an EXPERIMENTAL tool that allows you to establish a secure circuit with your existing encrypting TCP endpoints (an OpenVPN setup, an SSH server for forwarding...) when your network connection is limited by a Web proxy that only allows basic port 80 HTTP connectivity.  Crowbar will tunnel TCP connections over an HTTP session using only GET and POST requests. This is in contrast to most tunneling systems that reuse the CONNECT verb. It also provides basic authentication to make sure nobody who stumbles upon the server steals your proxy to order drugs from Silkroad.
			* [A Black Path Toward The Sun(ABPTTS)](https://github.com/nccgroup/ABPTTS)
				* ABPTTS uses a Python client script and a web application server page/package[1] to tunnel TCP traffic over an HTTP/HTTPS connection to a web application server. In other words, anywhere that one could deploy a web shell, one should now be able to establish a full TCP tunnel. This permits making RDP, interactive SSH, Meterpreter, and other connections through the web application server.
			* [pivotnacci](https://github.com/blackarrowsec/pivotnacci)
				* Pivot into the internal network by deploying HTTP agents. Pivotnacci allows you to create a socks server which communicates with HTTP agents

				* A TCP tunneling suite built with golang and gRPC. gTunnel can manage multiple forward and reverse tunnels that are all carried over a single TCP/HTTP2 connection. I wanted to learn a new language, so I picked go and gRPC. Client executables have been tested on windows and linux.
		* **ICMP**
			* [Hans - IP over ICMP - hans](http://code.gerade.org/hans/)
				* [Source](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hanstunnel/files/source/)
				* Hans makes it possible to tunnel IPv4 through ICMP echo packets, so you could call it a ping tunnel. This can be useful when you find yourself in the situation that your Internet access is firewalled, but pings are allowed.
			* [icmptx](https://github.com/jakkarth/icmptx)
				*  ICMPTX is a program that allows a user with root privledges to create a virtual network link between two computers, encapsulating data inside of ICMP packets.

				* Forward local or remote tcp ports through SMB pipes.
		* **SSH**
			* [SSHDog](https://github.com/Matir/sshdog)
				* SSHDog is your go-anywhere lightweight SSH server. Written in Go, it aims to be a portable SSH server that you can drop on a system and use for remote access without any additional configuration.	
			* [MeterSSH](https://github.com/trustedsec/meterssh)
				* MeterSSH is a way to take shellcode, inject it into memory then tunnel whatever port you want to over SSH to mask any type of communications as a normal SSH connection. The way it works is by injecting shellcode into memory, then wrapping a port spawned (meterpeter in this case) by the shellcode over SSH back to the attackers machine. Then connecting with meterpreter's listener to localhost will communicate through the SSH proxy, to the victim through the SSH tunnel. All communications are relayed through the SSH tunnel and not through the network.
			* [powermole](https://github.com/yutanicorp/powermolecli)
				* This program will let you perform port forwarding, redirect internet traffic, and transfer files to, and issue commands on, a host without making a direct connection (ie. via one or more intermediate hosts), which would undoubtedly compromise your privacy. This solution can only work when you or your peers own one or more hosts as this program communicates with SSH servers. This program can be viewed as a multi-versatile wrapper around SSH with the ProxyJump directive enabled. Powermole creates automatically a ssh/scp configuration file to enable key-based authentication with the intermediate hosts.

		* The shortcomings of anti-virus (AV) solutions have been well known for some time. Nevertheless, both public and private organizations continue to rely on AV software as a critical component of their information security programs, acting as a key protection mechanism over endpoints and other information systems within their networks. As a result, the security posture of these organizations is significantly jeopardized by relying only on this weakened control.

		* As a co-founder and principal developer of the Veil-Framework, the speaker has spent a considerable amount of time over the past year and a half researching AV-evasion techniques. This talk will briefly cover the problem space of antivirus detection, as well as the reaction to the initial release of Veil-Evasion, a tool for generating AV-evading executables that implements much of the speaker’s research. We will trace through the evolution of the obfuscation techniques utilized by Veil-Evasion’s generation methods, culminating in the release of an entirely new payload language class, as well as the release of a new ..NET encryptor. The talk will conclude with some basic static analysis of several Veil-Evasion payload families, showing once and for all that antivirus static signature detection is dead.

		* A funny thing happened when I evaluated several EDR, ETDR and Next Gen AV products, currently all the rage and latest must have security solution. Surprisingly to me the solutions kinda sucked at things we expected them to do or be better at, thus this talk so you can learn from our efforts. While testing, flaws were discovered and shared with the vendors, some of the flaws, bugs, or vulns that were discovered will be discussed. This talk takes a look at what we initially expected the solutions to provide us, the options or categories of what these solutions address, what to consider when doing an evaluation, how to go about testing these solutions, how they would fit into our process, and what we found while testing these solutions. What enraged me about these EDR solutions were how they were all over the place in how they worked, how hard or ease of use of the solutions, and the fact I found malware that did not trigger an alert on every solution I tested. And this is the next new bright and shiny blinky security savior solution? The news is not all bad, there is hope if you do some work to understand what these solutions target and provide, what to look for, and most importantly how to test them! What we never anticipated or expected is the tool we used to compare the tests and how well it worked and how it can help you.

In this talk, we will reveal ways that we bypass in-line network defenses, spam filters (in line and cloud based), as well as current endpoint solutions. Some techniques are old, some are new, but all work in helping to get a foothold established. Defenders: might want to come to this one.

		* The current endpoint monitoring capabilities we have available to us are unprecedented. Many tools and our self/community-built detection rules rely on parent-child relationships and command-line arguments to detect malicious activity taking place on a system. There are, however, ways the adversaries can get around these detections. During this presentation, we'll talk about the following techniques and how we can detect them: Parent-child relationships spoofing; Command-line arguments spoofing; Process injection; Process hollowing

			* In this article I am going to describe a way to execute code in windows kernel by using windbg local kernel debugging. It’s not a vulnerability, I am going to use only windbg’s legal functionality, and I am going to use only a batch file (not powershell, or vbs, an old style batch only) and some Microsoft’s signed executables (some of them that are already in the system and windbg, that we will be dumped from the batch file). With this method it is not necessary to launch executables at user mode (only Microsoft signed executables) or load signed drivers. PatchGuard and other protections don’t stop us. We put our code directly into kernel memory space and we hook some point to get a thread executing it. As we will demonstrate, a malware consisting of a simple batch file would be able to jump to kernel, enabling local kernel debugging and using windbg to get its code being executed in kernel.

			* [foolavc](https://github.com/hvqzao/foolavc)
				* This project is foolav continuation. Original foolav was offered only as x86 executable, used single encoding for externally kept payload file. Once foolav is executed, payload is loaded into memory and executed as a shellcode in separate thread. foolavc on the other hand supports both x86 and x86_64 architectures, allows use of both internal (built-in) or external payloads. Those can be interpreted in one of three ways: shellcode, DLL and EXEcutable.

			* Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected by usual defender tools. How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order to achieve advanced attacks? The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like `f0xffffe0010c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10`? We will be able to demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

We look at various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

				* [Paper](http://census.gr/media/context-keying-whitepaper.pdf)
				* Exploit payload encoding allows hiding maliciouspayloads from modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Although metamorphic and polymorphic encoding allow such payloads to be hidden from signature-based and anomaly-based IDS,these techniques fall short when the payload is being examined by IDS that can trace the execution of malicious code. Context-keyed encodingis a technique that allows the attacker to encrypt the malicious payload in such a way, that it canonly be executed in an environment (context) withspecific characteristics. By selecting an environment characteristic that will not be present during the IDS trace (but will be present on the target host), the attacker may evade detection by advanced IDS. This paper focuses on the current research in context-keyed payload encoding and proposes a novel encoder that surpasses many of the limitations found in its predecessors.

				* This talk focuses on the shellcode perspective and it’s evolution. From the simplest {shell}code to the polymorphism to bypass filters and I{D|P}S (which has lots of new ideas, like application-specific decoders, decoders based on architecture-instructions, and many others), passing through syscall proxying and injection, this talk will explain how it works and how effective they are against the new evolving technologies like network code emulation, with live demonstrations. There is long time since the first paper was released about shellcoding. Most of modern text just tries to explain the assembly structure and many new ideas have just been released as code, never been detailed or explained. The talk will try to fix this gap, also showing some new ideas and considering different architectures.

				* Our payloads are at risk! Incident responders, threat hunters, and automated software solutions are eager to pick apart your new custom dropper and send you back to square one. One answer to this problem is encrypting your payload with key derivation functions ("keying") which leverages a variety of local and remote resources to build the decryption key. Throughout this talk I will present modern keying techniques and demo some tools to help along the way. I will start with showing how easy it is to discover attacker infrastructure or techniques in the payloads we commonly use every day. I will then quickly review how keying helps and the considerations when generating keyed payloads. Throughout the presentation many practical examples of keying techniques will be provided which can be used for typical pentests or full red team operations. Finally I will introduce KeyServer, a new piece to add to your red team infrastructure which handles advanced HTTP and DNS keying. Using unprotected payloads during ops should be a thing of the past. Let’s regain control of our malicious code and make it harder on defenders! This talk is based on the original research of environmental keying by Josh Pitts and Travis Morrow.

We expound upon their properties and discuss some possible applications; the primary envisioned use of these constructions is in the creation of mobile agents whose analysis does not reveal their exact purpose.
			* [Strong Cryptography Armoured Computer VirusesForbidding Code Analysis: the bradley virusEric Filiol(2004)](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00070748/document)
				* Imagining what the nature of future viral attacks might look like is the key to successfully protecting against them. This paper discusses how cryptography and key management techniques may definitively checkmate antiviral analysis and mechanisms. We present a generic virus, denoted bradley which protects its code with a very secure, ultra-fast symmetric encryption. Since the main drawback of using encryption in that case lies on the existence of the secret key or information about it within the viral code, we show how to bypass this limitation by using suitable key management techniques. Finally, we show that the complexity of the bradley code analysis is at least as high as that of the cryptanalysis of its underlying encryption algorithm.

				* Imagine there is certain content we want to maintain private until some particular event occurs, when we want to have it automatically disclosed. Suppose, furthermore, that we want this done in a (possibly) malicious host. Say the confidential content is a piece of code belonging to a computer program that should remain ciphered and then “be triggered” (i.e., deciphered and executed) when the underlying system satisfies a preselected condition, which must remain secret after code inspection. In this work we present different solutions for problems of this sort, using different “declassification” criteria, based on a primitive we call secure triggers. We establish the notion of secure triggers in the universally composable security framework of Canetti [2001] and introduce several examples. Our examples demonstrate that a new sort of obfuscation is possible. Finally, we motivate its use with applications in realistic scenarios.

				* To solve the scalability problem introduced by the exponential growth of malware, numerous automated malware analysis techniques have been developed. Unfortunately, all of these approaches make previously unaddressed assumptions that manifest as weaknesses to the tenability of the automated malware analysis process. To highlight this concern, we developed two obfuscation techniques that make the successful execution of a malware sample dependent on the unique properties of the original host it infects. To reinforce the potential for malware authors to leverage this type of analysis resistance, we discuss the Flashback botnet’s use of a similar technique to prevent the automated analysis of its samples.
			* [Sleeping Your Way out of theSandbox - Hassan  Mourad(2015)](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/malicious/sleeping-sandbox-35797)
				* In recent years,the security landscape has witnessed the rise of a new breed of malware, Advanced  Persistence  Threat,  or  APT  for  short.  With  all  traditional  security  solutions failing  to  address  this  new  threat,  a  demand  was  created  for  new  solutions  that  are capable of addressing the advanced capabilities of APT. One of the offeredsolutions was file-based  sandboxes,asolution  that  dynamically  analyzes  files  and  judgestheir  threat levelsbased  on  their  behavior  in  an  emulated/virtual  environment.  But  security  is  a  cat and mouse game, and malware authors are always trying to detect/bypass such measures. Some of the common techniques used by malware for sandbox evasionwill be discussed in  this  paper. This  paperwill  also  analyze  how  to  turn somecountermeasuresused  by sandboxes against it. Finally, itwill introduce some new ideas for sandbox evasion along with recommendationsto address them.

The idea is that when your target visits the page, the key is fetched and the HTA is decrypted dynamically within the browser and pushed directly to the user. This is an evasion technique to get round content / file-type inspection implemented by some security-appliances. This tool is not designed to create awesome HTA content. There are many other tools/techniques that can help you with that. What it might help you with is getting your HTA into an environment in the first place, and (if you use environmental keying) to avoid it being sandboxed.

		* [Invoke-PSImage](https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-PSImage)
			* Invoke-PSImage takes a PowerShell script and embeds the bytes of the script into the pixels of a PNG image. It generates a oneliner for executing either from a file of from the web (when the -Web flag is passed). The least significant 4 bits of 2 color values in each pixel are used to hold the payload. Image quality will suffer as a result, but it still looks decent. The image is saved as a PNG, and can be losslessly compressed without affecting the ability to execute the payload as the data is stored in the colors themselves. It can accept most image types as input, but output will always be a PNG because it needs to be lossless. Each pixel of the image is used to hold one byte of script, so you will need an image with at least as many pixels as bytes in your script. This is fairly easy—for example, Invoke-Mimikatz fits into a 1920x1200 image.

	        * This talk will focus on detecting reflective injection with some mildly humorous notes and bypassing said protections until vendors start actually working on this problem. It seems amazing that reflective injection still works. Why is that? Because programmers are lazy. They don't want to write new engines, they want to write definitions for an engine that already exists. So what do we do about it? Release a $5 tool that does what $50 AV has failed epically at for several years now...oh and it took me a week or so...Alternately, you could license it to vendors since their programmers are lazy.

			* Reflective DLL injection is a library injection technique in which the concept of reflective programming is employed to perform the loading of a library from memory into a host process. As such the library is responsible for loading itself by implementing a minimal Portable Executable (PE) file loader. It can then govern, with minimal interaction with the host system and process, how it will load and interact with the host.

		 * This article is the obvious culmination of the previous effort of writing the Rebel.NET application and the first of a two series of articles about the .NET framework internals and the protections available for .NET assemblies. The next article will be about .NET native compiling. As the JIT inner workings haven't been analyzed yet, .NET protections are quite naļf nowadays. This situation will rapidly change as soon as the reverse engineering community will focus its attention on this technology. These two articles are aimed to raise the consiousness about the current state of .NET protections and what is possible to achieve but hasn't been done yet. In particular, the current article about .NET code injection represents, let's say, the present, whereas the next one about .NET native compiling represents the future. What I'm presenting in these two articles is new at the time I'm writing it, but I expect it to become obsolete in less than a year. Of course, this is obvious as I'm moving the first steps out from current .NET protections in the direction of better ones. But this article isn't really about protections: exploring the .NET framework internals can be useful for many purposes. So, talking about protections is just a means to an end.
