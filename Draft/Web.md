		* The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

	* [Paper Testing stateful web application workflows - SANS - András Veres-Szentkirályi](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/testing-stateful-web-application-workflows-36637)
		* Most web applications used for complex business operations and/or employing advanced GUI frameworks have stateful functionality. Certain workflows, for example, might require completing certain steps before a transaction is committed, or a request sent by a client-side UI element might need several preceding requests that all contribute to the session state. Most automated tools focus on a request and maybe a redirection, thus completely missing the point in these cases, where resending a request gets ignored by the target application. As a result, while these tools are getting better day by day, using them for testing such execution paths are usually out of the question. Since thorough assessment is cumbersome without such tools, there's progress, but we are far from plug-and-play products. This paper focuses on the capabilities of currently available solutions, demonstrating their pros and cons, along with opportunities for improvement.
* **Browsers**
	* [Browser-2020](https://github.com/luruke/browser-2020)
		* Things you can do with a browser in 2020
		* It's like, did no one read 'The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications'? Or did they, and their take away was, 'Man, what a bunch of great ideas! Blinking text with no user control? Woah. I'm so on this.'
		* My point is that it is 2020, and there is no equivalent to NoScript or UBlock Origin in any major browser. Despite this, I can have picture in picture video chats, while also connecting by bluetooth and USB, devices to the browser and having each tab color coded, along with the browser knowing my power level of my device, all according to standards.

		* This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If such an API is used on `http://example.org` resources, a resource on `http://hello-world.example` can opt in using the mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org` as response header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from `http://example.org`.

		*  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for relaxing the Same Origin Policy to enable communication between websites via browsers. It's already widely understood that certain CORS configurations are dangerous. In this presentation, I'll skim over the old knowledge then coax out and share with you an array of under-appreciated but dangerous subtleties and implications buried in the CORS specification. I'll illustrate each of these with recent attacks on real websites, showing how I could have used them to steal bitcoins from two different exchanges, partially bypass Google's use of HTTPS, and requisition API keys from numerous others. I'll also show how CORS blunders can provide an invaluable link in crafting exploit chains to pivot across protocols, exploit the unexploitable via server and client-side cache poisoning, and even escalate certain open redirects into vulnerabilities that are actually notable.

		* This document describes best current security practices for OAuth 2.0.. It updates and extends the OAuth 2.0 Security Threat Model to incorporate practical experiences gathered since OAuth 2.0 was published and cover new threats relevant due to the broader application of OAuth 2.0.
	* [OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol - rfc7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591)
		* This specification defines mechanisms for dynamically registering OAuth 2.0 clients with authorization servers. Registration requests send a set of desired client metadata values to the authorization server. The resulting registration responses return a client identifier to use at the authorization server and the client metadata values registered for the client. The client can then use this registration information to communicate with the authorization server using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This specification also defines a set of common client metadata fields and values for clients to use during registration.
	* [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT Secured Authorization Request - ietf.org](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwsreq-15)
		* The authorization request in OAuth 2.0 described in RFC 6749 utilizes query parameter serialization, which means that Authorization Request parameters are encoded in the URI of the request and sent through user agents such as web browsers. While it is easy to implement, it means that (a) the communication through the user agents are not integrity protected and thus the parameters can be tainted, and (b) the source of the communication is not authenticated. Because of these weaknesses, several attacks to the protocol have now been put forward. This document introduces the ability to send request parameters in a JSON Web Token (JWT) instead, which allows the request to be signed with JSON Web Signature (JWS) and encrypted with JSON Web Encryption (JWE) so that the integrity, source authentication and confidentiality property of the Authorization Request is attained. The request can be sent by value or by reference.
	* [OAuth 2.0 Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate Bound Access Tokens - ietf](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-07)
		* This document describes Transport Layer Security (TLS) mutual authentication using X.509 certificates as a mechanism for OAuth client authentication to the authorization sever as well as for certificate bound sender constrained access tokens as a method for a protected resource to ensure that an access token presented to it by a given client was issued to that client by the authorization server.

		* What if you roll out OAuth, and realize there are a bunch of small things you didn’t consider? It’s what happened to us at Pipedrive, and although it’s likely not over just yet, we’re running smoothly. It’s a good time to share what we’ve learned and save others some time. While building Pipedrive’s marketplace for third-party apps, we transitioned from API token authentication to OAuth, and it’s been an interesting learning experience. In this talk, I will explain how the protocol works, discuss differences in how OAuth is implemented on different platforms, and explain how we managed the transition from API token to OAuth. I will explain how CSRF attacks work in OAuth, how the state parameter can prevent them, how to manage synchronization between server and clients, and what you can run into when you roll out OAuth for dozens of apps.

	* [RFC 6454: The Web Origin Concept](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454)
		* This document defines the concept of an "origin", which is often used as the scope of authority or privilege by user agents. Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent malicious web site operators from interfering with the operation of benign web sites. In addition to outlining the principles that underlie the concept of origin, this document details how to determine the origin of a URI and how to serialize an origin into a string. It also defines an HTTP header field, named "Origin", that indicates which origins are associated with an HTTP request.

		* Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS), have become key components of the modern Internet. The privacy, integrity, and authenticity provided by these protocols are critical to allowing sensitive communications to occur. Without these systems, e-commerce, online banking, and business-to-business exchange of information would likely be far less frequent. Threat actors have also recognized the benefits of transport security, and they are increasingly turning to SSL to hide their activities. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT ) attackers, botnets, and eve n commodity web attacks can leverage SSL encryption to evade detection. To counter these tactics, organizations are increasingly deploying security controls that intercept end-to-end encrypted channels. Web proxies, data loss prevention (DLP) systems, specialized threat detection solutions, and network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) offer functionality to intercept, inspect, and filter encrypted traffic. Similar functionality is present in lawful intercept systems and solutions enabling the broad surveillance of encrypted communications by governments. Broadly classified as “SSL/TLS interception proxies”, these solutions act as a “man-in-the-middle", violating the end-to-end security promises of SSL. This type of interception comes at a cost. Intercepting SSL-encrypted connections sacrifices a degree of privacy and integrity for the benefit of content inspection, often at the risk of authenticity and endpoint validation. Implementers and designers of SSL interception proxies should consider these risks and understand how their systems operate in unusual circumstances

		* Abstract: Since the early days of Netscape, browser vendors and web security researchers have restricted out-going data based on its destination. The security argument accompanying these mechanisms is that they prevent sensitive user data from being sent to the attacker’s domain. However, in this paper, we show that regulating web information flow based on its destination server is an inherently flawed security practice. It is vulnerable to self-exfiltration attacks, where an adversary stashes stolen information in the database of a whitelisted site, then later independently connects to the whitelisted site to retrieve the information. We describe eight existing browser security mechanisms that are vulnerable to these “self-exfiltration” attacks. Furthermore, we discovered at least one exfiltration channel for each of the Alexa top 100 websites. None of the existing information flow control mechanisms we surveyed are sufficient to protect data from being leaked to the attacker. Our goal is to prevent browser vendors and researchers from falling into this trap by designing more systems that are vulnerable to self-exfiltration.

What if high-traffic websites served obfuscated code that secretly borrowed clock cycles from their client’s web browser as a means of distributed computing? In this talk I present research on the topic of using web browsers as zero-configuration, trojan-less botnets. The presentation includes a brief history of botnets, followed by an overview of techniques to build and deploy command-and-control botnet clients that run in-browser.

	* [The Spy in the Sandbox – Practical Cache Attacks in Javascript](http://iss.oy.ne.ro/SpyInTheSandbox.pdf)
		* We present the first micro-architectural side-channel attack which runs entirely in the browser. In contrast to other works in this genre, this attack does not require the attacker to install any software on the victim’s machine to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an untrusted webpage with attacker-controlled content. This makes the attack model highly scalable and extremely relevant and practical to today’s web, especially since most desktop browsers currently accessing the In- ternet are vulnerable to this attack. Our attack, which is an extension of the last-level cache attacks of Yarom et al., allows a remote adversary recover information belonging to other processes, other users and even other virtual machines running on the same physical host as the victim web browser. We describe the fundamentals behind our attack, evaluate its performance using a high bandwidth covert channel and finally use it to construct a system-wide mouse/network activity logger. Defending against this attack is possible, but the required counter- measures can exact an impractical cost on other benign uses of the web browser and of the computer.

		* As a part of an ongoing investigation on Adobe Flash SOP bypass techniques, we identified a vulnerability affecting old releases of the Adobe Flex SDK compiler. Further investigation traced the issue back to a well known vulnerability (CVE20112461), already patched by Adobe. Old vulnerability, let's move on? Not this time. CVE20112461 is a very interesting bug. As long as the SWF file was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK, attackers can still use this vulnerability against the latest web browsers and Flash plugin. Even with the most recent updates, vulnerable Flex applications hosted on your domain can be exploited. In this presentation, we will disclose the details of this vulnerability (Adobe has never released all technicalities) and we will discuss how we conducted a large scale analysis on popular websites, resulting in the identification of numerous Alexa Top 50 sites vulnerable to this bug.

			* We provide a number of practical techniques and algorithms for exploiting randomness vulnerabilities in PHP applications.We focus on the predictability of password reset tokens and demonstrate how an attacker can take over user accounts in a web application via predicting or algorithmically derandomizing the PHP core randomness generators. While our techniques are designed for the PHP language, the principles behind our techniques and our algorithms are independent of PHP and can readily apply to any system that utilizes weak randomness generators or low entropy sources. Our results include: algorithms that reduce the entropy of time variables, identifying and exploiting vulnera- bilities of the PHP system that enable the recovery or reconstruction of PRNG seeds, an experimental analysis of the Hastad-Shamir framework for breaking truncated linear variables, an optimized online Gaussian solver for large sparse linear systems, and an algorithm for recovering the state of the Mersenne twister generator from any level of truncation.  We demonstrate the gravity of our attacks via a number of case studies. Specifically, we show that a number of current widely used web applications can be broken using our tech- niques including Mediawiki, Joomla, Gallery, osCommerce and others.

However, the language has gone through extensive changes and none of previous exploitation techniques are relevant. In this talk, we explore the new memory internals of the language from exploiters and vulnerability researchers point of view. We will explain newly found vulnerabilities in the 'unserialize' mechanism of the language and present re-usable primitives for remote exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

We analyze how PHP object injection (POI) vulnerabilities can be exploited via property-oriented programming (POP) and perform a systematic analysis of available gadgets in common PHP applications. Furthermore, we introduce an automated approach to statically detect POI vulnerabilities in object-oriented PHP code. Our approach is also capable of generating POP chains in an automated way. We implemented a prototype of the proposed approach and evaluated it with 10 well-known applications. Overall, we detected 30 new POI vulnerabilities and 28 new gadget chains

		* REST, or Representational State Transfer, just refers to the protocol with which the whole Web works. No big. We are used to using REST with a browser, but there is more to it - we can write programs with REST. The problem is that writing properties and functions using the web's transfer protocol open them up to all of the security weaknesses of the web, and we know there are a few of those. Finding those bugs is just half of the battle - fixing them is a whole other story. You'll need the details, and you'll get them here.

WS-Attacks.org aims at delivering the most comprehensive enumeration of all known web service attacks.
	* [Astra](https://github.com/flipkart-incubator/Astra)
		* REST API penetration testing is complex due to continuous changes in existing APIs and newly added APIs. Astra can be used by security engineers or developers as an integral part of their process, so they can detect and patch vulnerabilities early during development cycle. Astra can automatically detect and test login & logout (Authentication API), so it's easy for anyone to integrate this into CICD pipeline. Astra can take API collection as an input so this can also be used for testing apis in standalone mode.

		* This paper describes how some HTML browsers can be tricked through the use of HTML forms into sending more or less arbitrary data to any TCP port. This can be used to send commands to servers using ASCII based protocols like SMTP, NNTP, POP3, IMAP, IRC, and others. By sending HTML email to unsuspecting users or using a trojan HTML page, an attacker might be able to send mail or post Usenet News through servers normally not accessible to him. In special cases an attacker might be able to do other harm, e.g. deleting mail from a POP3 mailbox.
	* [Cross-Protocol Request Forgery - Tanner Prynn(2018)](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/our-research/cross-protocol-request-forgery/)
		* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) are two attackmethods that enable attackers to cross network boundaries in order to attack applications,but can only target applications that speak HTTP. Custom TCP protocols are everywhere:IoT devices, smartphones, databases, development software, internal web applications, andmore. Often, these applications assume that no security is necessary because they are onlyaccessible over the local network. This paper aims to be a definitive overview of attacksthat allow cross-protocol exploitation of non-HTTP listeners using CSRF and SSRF, and alsoexpands on the state of the art in these types of attacks to target length-specified protocolsthat were not previously thought to be exploitable.

			* This presentation will examine the largely underresearched topic of rich internet applications (RIAs) security in the hopes of illustrating how the complex interactions with their executing environment, and general bad security practices, can lead to exploitable applications. In recent years rich internet applications (RIAs) have become the mainstay of large internet applications and are becoming increasingly attractive to the industry due to their similarity to desktop applications. Furthermore their user of exsting web technologies such as HTTP, HTML/XML and Javascript/Actionscript make them attractive options to companies with existing web developers. Unfortunately the use of existing technologies brings with it the burden of existing ways to write vulnerable code, but adds yet more ways. This presentation will examine the largely underresearched topic of RIA security in the hopes of illustrating how the complex interactions with their executing environment, and general bad security practices, can lead to exploitable applications.

			* In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remainsafter XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mit-igated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScriptcode. We address the question of whether an attacker reallyneeds JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacksaiming for information theft. The surprising result is thatan attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) incombination with other Web techniques like plain HTML,inactive SVG images or font files.  Through several casestudies, we introduce the so calledscriptless attacksanddemonstrate that an adversary might not need to executecode to preserve his ability to extract sensitive informationfrom well protected websites. More precisely, we show thatan attacker can use seemingly benign features to build sidechannel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrarydata displayed on a given website.We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mit-igation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition,we have implemented a browser patch that enables a websiteto make a vital determination as to being loaded in a de-tached view or pop-up window. This approach proves usefulfor prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

		* Most people are familiar with homograph attacks due to phishing or other attack campaigns using Internationalized Domain Names with look-alike characters. But homograph attacks exist against wide variety of systems that have gotten far less attention. This talk discusses the use of homographs to attack machine learning systems, to submit malicious software patches, and to craft cryptographic canary traps and leak repudiation mechanisms. It then introduces a generalized defense strategy that should work against homograph attacks in any context.

		* Web homograph attacks have existed for some time, and the recent adoption of International Domain Names (IDNs) support by browsers and DNS registrars has exacerbated the problem [Gabr02]. Many international letters have similar glyphs, such as the Cyrillic letter P (lower case 'er,' Unicode 0x0440) and the Latin letter p. Because of the large potential for misuse of IDNs, browser vendors, policy advocates, and researchers have been exploring techniques for mitigating homograph attacks [=Mozi05, Appl05, Oper05, Mark05]. There has been plenty of attention on the problem recently, but we are not aware of any data that quantifies the degree to which Web homograph attacks are currently taking place. In this paper, we use a combination of passive network tracing and active DNS probing to measure several aspects of Web homographs. Our main findings are four-fold. First, many authoritative Web sites that users visit have several confusable domain names registered. Popular Web sites are much more likely to have such confusable domains registered. Second, registered confusable domain names tend to consist of single character substitutions from their authoritative domains, though we saw instances of five-character substitutions. Most confusables currently use Latin character homographs, but we did find a non-trivial number of IDN homographs. Third, Web sites associated with non-authoritative confusable domains most commonly show users advertisements. Less common functions include redirecting victims to competitor sites and spoofing the content of authoritative site. Fourth, during our nine-day trace, none of the 828 Web clients we observed visited a non-authoritative confusable Web site. Overall, our measurement results suggest that homograph attacks currently are rare and not severe in nature. However, given the recent increases in phishing incidents, homograph attacks seem like an attractive future method for attackers to lure users to spoofed sites.

		* An Unrestricted File Upload (UFU) vulnerability is a critical security threat that enables an adversary to upload her choice of a forged file to a target web server. This bug evolves into an Unrestricted Executable File Upload (UEFU) vulnerability when the adversary is able to conduct remote code execution of the uploaded file via triggering its URL. We design and implement FUSE, the first penetration testing tool designed to discover UFU and UEFU vulnerabilities in server-side PHP web applications. The goal of FUSE is to generate upload requests; each request becomes an exploit payload that triggers a UFU or UEFU vulnerability. However, this approach entails two technical challenges: (1) it should generate an upload request that bypasses all content-filtering checks present in a target web application; and (2) it should preserve the execution semantic of the resulting uploaded file. We address these technical challenges by mutating standard upload requests with carefully designed mutation operations that enable the bypassing of content- filtering checks and do not tamper with the execution of uploaded files. FUSE discovered 30 previously unreported UEFU vulnerabilities, including 15 CVEs from 33 real-world web applications, thereby demonstrating its efficacy in finding code execution bugs via file uploads.

It was first documented in 2005, and was again repopularized by PortSwigger's research.

		* HTTP is everywhere, everybody wants to write an HTTP server. So I wrote mine :-) But mine not fast, and come with an HTTP client which sends very bad HTTP queries. My tool is a stress tester for HTTP servers and proxies, and I wrote it because I found flaws in all HTTP agents that I have checked in the last year i.e. nodejs, golang, Apache httpd, FreeBSD http, Nginx, Varnish and even Haproxy. This presentation will try to explain how flaws in HTTP parsers can be exploited for bad things; we'll play with HTTP to inject unexpected content in the user browser, or perform actions in his name. If you know nothing about HTTP it should be understandable, but you'll have to trust me blindly at the end. If you think you know HTTP, you have no reason to avoid this talk. Then, the short part, I will show you this new Open Source stress tool that I wrote and hope that you will remember it when you'll write your own HTTP parser for you new f** language.

This talk will look into injection flaws in the user interface of Mozilla Firefox, which is implemented in JS, HTML, and an XML-dialect called XUL. With an Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the user interface attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the main browser application process. This allows for cross-platform exploits of high reliability. The talk discusses past vulnerabilities and will also suggest mitigations that benefit Single Page Applications and other platforms that may suffer from DOM-based XSS, like Electron.

		* RPO (Relative Path Overwrite) is a technique to take advantage of relative URLs by overwriting their target file. To understand the technique we must first look into the differences between relative and absolute URLs. An absolute URL is basically the full URL for a destination address including the protocol and domain name whereas a relative URL doesn’t specify a domain or protocol and uses the existing destination to determine the protocol and domain.

First, I introduce an in-browser approach calledExcisionto automatically detect and block malicious third-party content in-clusions as web pages are loaded into the user’s browser or during the execu-tion of browser extensions. Then, I proposeOriginTracer, an in-browserapproach to highlight extension-based content modification of web pages. Fi-1 nally, I present the first in-depth study of style injection vulnerability usingRPO and discuss potential countermeasures

The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

		* Due to their high practical impact, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks have attracted a lot of attention from the security community members. In the same way, a plethora of more or less effective defense techniques have been proposed, addressing the causes and effects of XSS vulnerabilities. As a result, an adversary often can no longer inject or even execute arbitrary scripting code in several real-life scenarios. In this paper, we examine the attack surface that remains after XSS and similar scripting attacks are supposedly mitigated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScript code. We address the question of whether an attacker really needs JavaScript or similar functionality to perform attacks aiming for information theft. The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML, inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive informati on from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrar y data displayed on a given website. We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mitigation techniques against this class of attacks. In addition, we have implemented a browser patch that enables a website to make a vital determination as to being loaded in a detached view or pop-up window. This approach proves useful for prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

			* Back in 2007, Hasegawa discovered a novel Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vector based on the mistreatment of the backtick character in a single browser implementation. This initially looked like an implementation error that could easily be fixed. Instead, as this paper shows, it was the first example of a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML and related properties. mXSS affects all three major browser families: IE, Firefox, and Chrome. We were able to place stored mXSS vectors in high-profile applications like Yahoo! Mail, Rediff Mail, OpenExchange, Zimbra, Roundcube, and several commercial products. mXSS vectors bypassed widely deployed server-side XSS protection techniques (like HTML Purifier, kses, htmlLawed, Blueprint and Google Caja), client-side filters (XSS Auditor, IE XSS Filter), Web Application Firewall (WAF) systems, as well as Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS). We describe a scenario in which seemingly immune entities are being rendered prone to an attack based on the behavior of an involved party, in our case the browser. Moreover, it proves very difficult to mitigate these attacks: In browser implementations, mXSS is closely related to performance enhancements applied to the HTML code before rendering; in server side filters, strict filter rules would break many web applications since the mXSS vectors presented in this paper are harmless when sent to the browser. This paper introduces and discusses a set of seven different subclasses of mXSS attacks, among which only one was previously known. The work evaluates the attack surface, showcases examples of vulnerable high-profile applications, and provides a set of practicable and low-overhead solutions to defend against these kinds of attacks.
		* [Automation of Mutated Cross Site Scripting - Anchal Tiwari, J. Jeysree](https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v4i4/SUB152876.pdf)	
			* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. In browsers Mutation event occur when there is a change in the DOM Structure of the browsers. There are various ways in which DOM structure could be changed among which innerHTML property is discussed specifically. mXSS is a new class of XSS vectors, the class of mutation-based XSS (mXSS) vectors, which may occur in innerHTML andrelated properties. mXSS affects all three major browserfamilies: IE, Firefox, and Chrome.mXSS could be placed in major browser families and effecting major web applications. In this paper we apply the idea of mutation-based testing technique to generate adequate test data sets for testing XSSVs. Our work addresses XSSVs related to web-applications that use PHP and JavaScript code to generate dynamic HTML contents. Finally there would be the development of an automatic tool which would generate mutants automatically, automatically testing the web application and finally giving the output.

As the user was originally on the correct page they are less likely to notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially it the site looks the same as the target. If the user authenticates to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to the phishing site rather than the legitimate one.

		* We present the first formulation of a happens-before relation for common web platform features. Developing this relation was a non-trivial task, due to complex feature interactions and browser differences. We also present a logical memory access model for web applications that abstracts away browser implementation details. Based on the above, we implemented WEBRACER, the first dynamic race detector for web applications. WEBRACER is implemented atop the production-quality WebKit engine, enabling testing of full-featured web sites. WEBRACER can also simulate certain user actions, exposing more races. We evaluated WEBRACER by testing a large set of Fortune 100 company web sites. We discovered many harmful races, and also gained insights into how developers handle asynchrony in practice.

		* Web Cache Deception attack is a new web attack vector that puts various technologies and frameworks at risk. By manipulating behaviors of web servers and caching mechanisms, anonymous attackers can expose sensitive information of authenticated application users, and in certain cases to even take control over their accounts. 
	* [Cached and Confused: Web Cache Deception in the Wild - Seyed Ali Mirheidari, Sajjad "JJ" Arshad(h@ckivitycon 2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czDfMWBsIKw)
		* Web Cache Deception (WCD) has been introduced in 2017 by Omer Gil, where an intruder lures a caching server to mistakenly store private information publicly and as a result obtains unauthorized access to cached data. In this talk, we will introduce new exploitation techniques based on the semantic disconnect among different framework-independent web technologies (e.g., browsers, CDNs, web servers) which results in different URL path interpretations. We coined the term ‚ÄúPath Confusion‚Äù to represent this disagreement and we will present the effectiveness of this technique on WCD attack. In February 2020, our related research was voted and led to an award as the top web hacking technique of 2019 by PortSwigger.   We explore WCD as an instance of the path confusion class of attacks, and demonstrate that variations on the path confusion technique make it possible to exploit sites that are otherwise not impacted by the original attack. Our findings show that many popular sites remain vulnerable three years after the public disclosure of WCD. To further elucidate the seriousness of path confusion, we will also present the large scale analysis results of WCD attack on high profile sites. We present a semi-automated path confusion crawler which detects hundreds of sites that are still vulnerable to WCD only with specific types of path confusion techniques. We conclude the talk with explaining why path confusion is so complicated to remediate while shedding light on potential areas that researchers and bughunters can apply new attack vectors through different path confusion techniques.
