	* [SCORE: Law Enforcement FAQ - SANS(2004)](https://www.sans.org/score/law-enforcement-faq/)
		* If we are going to turn the tide against computer attacks, the entire information security community must cooperate more effectively than ever before. The private sector, government agencies, and law enforcement must cooperate in responding to computer attacks. Yet, many security personnel aren't familiar with how to engage law enforcement effectively. For example, when should you call local or national law enforcement to help handle a case? How can you develop communication channels with law enforcement? This FAQ addresses these questions and more, with the goal of helping to foster communication with the law enforcement community. This project was developed as part of the SANS Institute's Cyber Defense Initiative ® (CDI). Each year, SANS polls the security community for ideas about CDI collaborative projects we can all use to help improve our security. Volunteers from around the world pour enormous amounts of effort to bring these projects to fruition, including this FAQ.

				* A planned methodology for developing and implementing a forensically sound incident response plan in Microsoft’s Office 365 cloud environment must be thoroughly researched and re-evaluated over time as the system evolves, new features are introduced, and older capabilities are deprecated. This presentation will walk through the numerous forensic, incident response, and evidentiary aspects of Office 365. The presentation is based on two years’ worth of collection of forensics and incident response data in Microsoft’s Office 365 and Azure environments. It combines knowledge from more than a hundred Office 365 investigations, primarily centered around Business Email Compromise (BEC) and insider threat cases.

			* When responding to an incident in your containers, you don’t necessarily have the same tools at your disposal that you do with VMs - and so your incident investigation process and forensics are different. In a best case scenario, you have access to application logs, orchestrator logs, node snapshots, and more.  In this talk, we’ll go over where to get information about what’s happening in your cluster, including logs and open source tools you can install, and how to tie this information together to get a better idea of what’s happening in your infrastructure. Armed with this info, we’ll review the common mitigation options such as to alert, isolate, pause, restart, or kill a container. For common types of container attacks, we'll discuss what options are best and why. Lastly, we’ll talk about restoring services after an incident, and the best steps to take to prevent the next one.

		* [Incident Response is HARRRRRD: But It Doesn't Have to Be - Michael Gough(WWHF2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlxCjc6V_lc)
			* So your EDR, AV, or other fancy shiny blinky lights security tools alerted you that Bobs Windows box has some suspicious activity.  Do you have the details you need to investigate or remediate the system?  Can you quickly and easily investigate it?   You can enable a lot of things you already have for FREE to help you with your investigations, no matter the tools used.  Let’s take a look at how we do Incident Response on Windows systems and what you can do to prepare for an inevitable event. How is your logging? Is it enabled? Configured to some best practice? (hopefully better than an industry standard that is seriously lacking). Have you enabled some critical logs that by default Microsoft does NOT enable? Do you have a way to run a command, script, or a favorite tool across one or all your systems and retrieve the results? Do you block some well-known exploitable file types so users do not initiate the scripting engine when they double click, rather just open good ol’ Notepad? Everything mentioned here is FREE and you already have it! This talk will describe these things and how to prepare, and be PREPARED to do incident Response on Windows systems. A few tools will be discussed as well that you can use to speed things up. The attendee can take the information from this talk and immediately start improving their environment to prepare for the… inevitable, an incident.

				* Incident Response procedures differ in the cloud versus when performed in traditional, on-premise, environments. The cloud offers the ability to respond to an incident by programmatically collecting evidence and quarantining instances but with this programmatic ability comes the risk of a compromised API key. The risk of a compromised key can be mitigated but proper configuration and monitoring must be in place. The talk discusses the paradigm of Incident Response in the cloud and introduces tools to automate the collection of forensic evidence of a compromised host. It highlights the need to properly configure an AWS environment and provides a tool to aid the configuration process.

An important value with IRMA comes from you keep control over where goes / who gets your data. Once you install IRMA on your network, your data stays on your network.  Each submitted files is analyzed in various ways. For now, we focus our efforts on multiple anti-virus engines, but we are working on other "probes" (feel free to submit your own).

	* [Human Hunting](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidessf2015/108-human-hunting-sean-gillespie) 
		* Much of what appears to be happening in information security seems to be focused on replacing humans with magic boxes and automation rather than providing tools to augment human capabilities. However, when we look at good physical security we see technology is being used to augment human capabilities rather than simply replace them. The adversary is human so we are ultimately looking for human directed behaviors. If analysts don't know how to go looking for evil without automated detection tools then they are not going to be able to effectively evaluate if the detection tools are working properly or if the deployment was properly engineered. An over reliance on automated detection also puts organizations in a position of paying protection money if they want to remain secure. We should be spending more resources on honing analyst hunting skills to find human adversaries rather than purchasing more automated defenses for human adversaries to bypass.

		* The largest organizations in the world rely on SAP platforms to run their critical processes and keep their business crown jewels: financial information, customer data, intellectual property, credit cards, human resources salaries, sensitive materials, suppliers and more. Everything is there and attackers know it. For several years at Onapsis we have been researching on how cyber-criminals might be able to break into ERP systems in order to help organizations better protect themselves. This has enabled us to gain a unique expertise on which are the most critical attack vectors and what kind of traces they leave (and don’t) over the victim’s SAP platforms. SAP systems need to be ready for Forensic Analysis, so the big question is: Are your systems prepared to retain the attackers breadcrumbs in the event of an attack? Join us and learn how to do a forensic analysis of an SAP system, looking for traces of a security breach We will also show novel techniques being used by attackers to avoid being detected during post attack forensic investigations. Vulnerabilities related to anti-forensic techniques will be presented together with their mitigation. **NEW** New attacks never presented before will be shown. JAVA, ABAP and BO systems will be covered.

		* Everyone's heard the claim: Security through obscurity is no security at all. Challenging this claim is the entire field of steganography itself - the art of hiding things in plain sight. Most people know you can hide a text file inside a photograph, or embed a photograph inside an MP3. But how does this work under the hood? What's new in the stego field?  This talk will explore how various techniques employed by older steganographic tools work and will discuss a new technique developed by the speaker which embodies both data hiding and data enciphering properties by encoding data inside NTFS volumes. A new tool will be released during this talk that will allow attendees to both encode and decode data with this new scheme.

		* Want to learn how to avoid surveillance and investigators? Anti-forensics is the practice of modifying or removing data so that others cannot find it later during an investigation. While annoying to forensic practitioners and law enforcement, it is unavoidable to help maintain privacy in a world of shady ToS, snooping partners, and potential search and seizures. How far do you need to go to maintain your privacy? This talk will break down anti-forensics techniques that you can use to protect yourself from audiences like your mom to an extreme nation-state level actor. The only thing more fun than forensics is anti-forensics.

The virtual representation can be in raw DD, DMG, VHD, VirtualBox's virtual disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK file format. Input images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF (Advanced Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This makes it possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM, VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.

    	*  Forensic analysis is sometimes all about grasping for straws. You never know what time little piece of data can make a difference in an investigation. We focus so much on native forensic artifacts that we lose sight of what third party applications provide us. I’m a huge proponent of having monitoring tools to keep track of what is happening on my system and to (hopefully) protect it. These tools are inherently monitoring the system, what data can they provide to forensic investigators?  This talk will go through some of the most popular monitoring utilities to show what they record and how that can help move forward investigations.

When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."

			* Telemetry is the automated sensing and collection of data from a remote device. It is often used to provide better services for users. Microsoft uses telemetry to periodically collect information about Windows systems and to help improve user experience and fix potential issues. Windows telemetry service functions by creating RBS files on the local system to reliably transfer and manage the telemetry data, and these files can provide useful information in a digital forensic investigation. Combined with the information derived from traditional Windows forensics, investigators can have greater confidence in the evidence derived from various artifacts. It is possible to acquire information that can be confirmed only for live systems, such as the computer hardware serial number, the connection records for external storage devices, and traces of executed processes. This information is included in the RBS files that are created for use in Windows telemetry. In this paper, we introduced how to acquire RBS files telemetry and analyzed the data structure of these RBS files, which are able to determine the types of information that Windows OS have been collected. We also discussed the reliability and the novelty by comparing the conventional artifacts with the RBS files, which could be useful in digital forensic investigation.

			* BTA is an open-source Active Directory security audit framework. Its goal is to help auditors harvest the information they need to answer such questions as:
				* Who has rights over a given object (computer, user account, etc.) ?
				* Who can read a given mailbox ?
				* Which are the accounts with domain admin rights ?
				* Who has extended rights (userForceChangePassword, SendAs, etc.) ?
				* What are the changes done on an AD between two points in time ?
		* [ADTimeline](https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ADTimeline/)
			* The ADTimeline script generates a timeline based on Active Directory replication metadata for objects considered of interest.

		* [PoSH-R2](https://github.com/WiredPulse/PoSh-R2)
			* PoSH-R2 is a set of Windows Management Instrumentation interface (WMI) scripts that investigators and forensic analysts can use to retrieve information from a compromised (or potentially compromised) Windows system. The scripts use WMI to pull this information from the operating system. Therefore, this script will need to be executed with a user that has the necessary privileges.

		* Beagle is an incident response and digital forensics tool which transforms data sources and logs into graphs. Supported data sources include FireEye HX Triages, Windows EVTX files, SysMon logs and Raw Windows memory images. The resulting Graphs can be sent to graph databases such as Neo4J or DGraph, or they can be kept locally as Python NetworkX objects. Beagle can be used directly as a python library, or through a provided web interface.

	* [StegExpose](https://github.com/b3dk7/StegExpose)
		* StegExpose is a steganalysis tool specialized in detecting LSB (least significant bit) steganography in lossless images such as PNG and BMP. It has a command line interface and is designed to analyse images in bulk while providing reporting capabilities and customization which is comprehensible for non forensic experts. StegExpose rating algorithm is derived from an intelligent and thoroughly tested combination of pre-existing pixel based staganalysis methods including Sample Pairs by Dumitrescu (2003), RS Analysis by Fridrich (2001), Chi Square Attack by Westfeld (2000) and Primary Sets by Dumitrescu (2002). In addition to detecting the presence of steganography, StegExpose also features the quantitative steganalysis (determining the length of the hidden message). StegExpose is part of my MSc of a project at the School of Computing of the University of Kent, in Canterbury, UK.
